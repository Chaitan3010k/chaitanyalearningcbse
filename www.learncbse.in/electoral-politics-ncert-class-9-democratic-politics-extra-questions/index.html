Once the voters go inside the booth, the election officials identify them, put a mark on their finger and allow then to cast their vote. An agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way.</p>

<h3>Electoral Politics Class 9 Extra Questions Long Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What are the challenges to free and fair elections in India?<br />
Answer:<br />
The elections in India are basically free and fair. But, a few candidates may win purely based on money power and unfair means. These challenges exist not just in India but also in many established democracies. These deeper issues are a matter of concern for those who believe in democracy. The challenges to free and fair elections in India are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Candidates and parties with a lot of money may not be sure of their victory but they do enjoy a big and unfair advantage over smaller parties and independents.</li>
<li>In some parts of the country, candidates with criminal connection have been able to push others out of the electoral race and to secure a ‘ticket’ from major parties.</li>
<li>Some families tend to dominate political parties; tickets are distributed to relatives from these families.</li>
<li>Very often elections offer little choice to ordinary citizens, for both the major parties are quite similar to each other both in policies and practice.</li>
<li>Smaller parties and independent candidates suffer a huge disadvantage compared to bigger parties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
How can you say that the outcome of elections is a final test of free and fair elections? Explain<br />
Answer:<br />
One final test of the free and fair of election has in the outcome itself. If elections are not free or fair, the outcome always favours the powerful. In such a situation, the ruling parties do not lose elections. Usually, the losing party does not accept the outcome of a rigged election.<br />
The outcome of India’s elections speaks for itself:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ruling parties routinely lose elections in India both at the national and state level. In fact, in every two out of the three elections held in the last fifteen years, the ruling party lost.</li>
<li>In the US, an incumbent or ‘sitting’ elected representative rarely loses an election. In India, about half of the sitting MPs or MLAs lose elections.</li>
<li>Candidates who are known to have spent a lot of money on ‘buying votes’ and<br />
those with known criminal connections often lose elections.</li>
<li>Barring very few disputed elections, the electoral outcomes are usually accepted as ‘people’s verdict’ by the defeated party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What do you mean by Voter’s List? What is its significance?<br />
Answer:<br />

(ii) The significance of Voter’s List is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is an important step for it is linked to the first condition of a democratic election. Everyone should get an equal opportunity to choose representatives.</li>
<li>In our country, all the citizens aged 18 years and above can vote in an election. Every citizen has the right to vote, regardless of his or her caste, religion or gender.</li>
<li>It is the responsibility of the government to get the names of all the eligible voters put on the Voter’s List. As new persons attain voting age, names are added to the voters’ list. Names of those who move out of a place or those who are dead are deleted.</li>
<li>A complete revision of the list takes place every five years. This is done to ensure that it remains up to date. In the last few years a new system of Election Photo Identity Card (EPIC) has been introduced. The government has tried to give this card to every person on the voters’ list. But the card is not yet compulsory for voting. For voting, the voters can show many other proofs of identity like the ration card or the driving licence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Explain the role of the Election Commission in conducting the free and fair elections.<br />
Answer:<br />

<li>When on election duty, government officers work under the control of the Election Commission and not the government.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What are the changing trends of people’s participation in elections in India?<br />
Answer:<br />

<li>In India, the poor, illiterate and underprivileged people vote in larger proportion as compared to the rich and privileged sections. This is in contrast to western democracies.</li>
<li>Common people in India attach a lot of importance to elections. They feel that through elections, they can bring pressure on political parties to adopt policies and programmes favourable to them.</li>
<li>The interest of voters in election-related activities has been increasing over the years. During the 2004 elections, more than one-third voters took part in a campaign-related activity.</li>
