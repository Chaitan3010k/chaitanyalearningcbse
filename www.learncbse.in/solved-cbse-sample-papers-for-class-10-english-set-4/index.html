READING</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:<br />
If you are addicted to coffee and doctors warn you to quit the habit, don’t worry and just keep relishing the beverage, because it is jiot that bad after all! In fact, according to a new study, the steaming cup of Java can beat fruits and vegetables as the primary source of antioxidants. Some studies state that coffee is the number one source of antioxidants in the American diet, and both caffeinated and decaf versions appear to provide similar antioxidant levels.<br />
Antioxidants in general have been linked to a number of potential health benefits, including protection against heart diseases and cancer, but Vinson, a dietician said that their benefits ultimately depend on how they are absorbed and utilized in the body. The research says that coffee outranks popular antioxidant sources like tea, milk, chocolate and cranberries. Of all the foods and beverages studied, dates actually have the most antioxidants based solely on the serving size, but since dates are not consumed anywhere near the level of coffee, the drink comes as the top source of antioxidants, Vinson said.<br />
Besides keeping you alert and awake, coffee has been linked to an increasing number of potential health benefits, including protection against liver and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease, according to some recently published studies.<br />
The researchers, however, advise that one should consume coffee in moderation, because it can make you jittery and cause stomach pains.<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">THE FACE OF VILLAGE INDIA</p>
<p>Thirteen years ago, when the then American President Bill Clinton drove down to Rampur Mani Haran village in western UP, he had come there to open a women’s polytechnic, funded by a prominent NRI. Today, the Bill Clinton school stands bright and shiny on the same campus, among low slung building that, house libraries and class rooms. According to the School President Raj Kamal Saxena, there are 565 students studying under CBSE of whom 234 are girls. Besides the local folk, the affluent families across the socials spectrum sent their children to this institution.<br />
The success story of the school in the area has given rise to a spate of educational institutions along the road from Shamli to Saharanpur. All of them promise to unlock exciting career options especially for the landed class of the area. These schools carry trendy names and have sprung up in the years after the 42nd President of the US came calling. Sitting amidst sugarcane fields and mango orchards they present a picture of society trying to change.<br />
Despite such a positive social factor visible in the area, there is little evidence of all round changes in the area. The roads are battered and dusty. The dream of an all weather road remains a dream. Steady power supply is unthinkable and traditional industries are now on a decline. Added to these are the problems of governance such as law and order situation.<br />
According to locals, people in the region are looking for a change. The driving force behind this urge for change are the youth. Most of the young men who have returned to the area have been educated in Delhi and have returned to work in their home town and for them the development of the region overrides all other concerns. Among the semi agrarian middle classes, the call for a change is not through the region’s facilities, but through the ballot box. They are eager for a change in the very government of the state.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Clean India is the mission of the government to present the beautiful picture of the country.<br />
• Cleanliness is next to Godliness &#8211; creates good hygienic condition in the country.<br />
• Pollution free environment.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Importance of Clean Surroundings in our Locality<br />
By: Ram<br />
Cleanliness is one’s precious possession. It is next to Godliness. As we worship God, in the same way, it is our utmost duty to keep our surroundings clean and ultimately create good hygienic conditions in the country. Seeing its importance, ’Clean India’ has been declared the important mission of the government, i.e., to present the beautiful picture of the country to the world.<br />
Cleanliness means keeping one’s body, mind, dress and surroundings clean. A person who wears dirty clothes, keeps his house dirty and makes the surroundings unhygienic will soon lose his health and also make others fall ill. Disease germs breed, grow and multiply in the dirty surroundings. Contagious diseases are caused due to dirty surroundings and dirty people. As regular washing of body and clothes is important for our health, regular cleaning of environment is important for a<br />
nation’s health because clean environment is the prior condition of a healthy society and healthy country. Dirt is the symbol of moral evil and cleanliness is the symbol of moral poverty. The basic requirement of creating clean surroundings is to make it pollution fee. So it is the moral duty of every person to work for the cause by not littering here and there, planting more and more trees and by keeping the place free of industrial waste and garbage.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Write a story in 150-200 words from the outline given below:<br />
A boy was playing in the park. He saw a small sparrow sitting on a stone. He went near it, still it didn’t fly. He&#8230;.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Write a story in 150-200 words from the outline given below :<br />
You were playing cricket in a park. Suddenly you saw an old man, just collapsing on the pavement. You all rushed to him&#8230;..<br />
Answer:<br />
&#8230;&#8230;He made some noise by clapping and by shouting &#8220;Mithu! Mithu!&#8221;. Even then, it didn’t make any effort to fly. Then hesitatingly, he picked up the bird in his hand. Only then he noticed that there was an injury in one of its legs. To show his affection towards the bird, he patted on it back. Then the sparrow looked at him, perhaps with a hope of getting a saviour. Actually, it was hurt by some naughty ’hunter’.<br />
Thereafter, he took the bird in his hand and decided to bring it to his home. When he reached home, he showed the injury of the bird to his mother. His mother became very happy to see the generous attitude of his child. She went in the kitchen, came oack with some turmeric powder. Then she applied the pack of powder on the injurec eg of the bird and covered it with gauge. Perhaps the sparrow felt itself comfortable and started chirping. The boy brought two earthern pots for it one for water and one for food. After two days of intense care, the sparrow became healthy. It started eating everything that the boy gave to him. As soon as the boy entered the house, the sparrow chirped with joy. After a week, it became completely fit. His mother asked him to free it like any other bird. Initially, the boy didn’t like the idea but when his mother taught him the importance of freedom, he agreed. Next morning, he went to the same garden where he had found it.<br />
No sooner did he enter the park than he heard chirping of many sparrows. They might be its siblings. As soon as he made the bird free, it joined its group, chirped loudly and danced with joy. The boy also became very happy and contented to see all that.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>One day, I was playing cricket in a park with my friends, suddenly I saw an old man, just collapsing on the pavement. All of us rushed to him, tried to call him. But he was unconscious. Sensing the need of the hour, I ran back, took out the water bottle from my bag and threw some water on his face. After a few moments, he opened his eyes. With gestures, he told us that he was very thirsty and hungry. We gave him water to drink. One of my friends gave him a packet of biscuits. I gave him two bananas that I had brought with me from my home. After having all that, the old man looked quite satisfied.<br />
Then we asked him about his whereabouts so that his family members should be informed. But to our surprise, on hearing the word family, he started crying bitterly. We tried to soothe him and asked what had made him to suffer. Then he told us his story. He had two sons. After the death of his wife, his sons asked him, rather pressurised him for the division of his property. Both of them assured him that he would live with them turn-wise, i.e., for one month, he would live with his younger son and then the next month, he would live with the elder one. And he agreed to do so. But that was the biggest mistake of his life. For two months, everything went quite okay. In the third month, he fell ill. None of his son wanted to bear the expenses, incurred on his illness and medicines. Then they made a plan. One day both of them asked him that they would take him to an expert doctor so that he would get cured very soon. And they did a blunder. They brought him to that strange city and asked him to wait there as they had to search out the address of the doctor. He agreed and waited for them, sitting outside the bus station, with no money or assets with him.<br />
When both of them didn’t return till evening, he realized that his sons had abandoned him. Even then he tried to search for them-empty stomach. On hearing his saga, we became very sad. Then one of my friends suggested that he should be taken to an old age home where his father was a manager. Since then, he has been living there but his sons never turned up.</p>

A baker can be recognized due to thud and jingle of his traditional bamboo with which he enters. He can also be recognized by his particular dress Kabai- the single piece long frock, reaching down to the knees.</p>
<p>(b) Natalya is the only daughter of the landowner Chubukov. She was very possessive about her land and was very determined not to part with it.

<p>Question 10.<br />
Answer the following question in 100-120 words :<br />
The author shares a lot of information about the bakers in his home town when he was young. He appears to be a very observant child. Should children have such keen observation powers ?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>What does ’fire’ and ’ice’ stand for and what is the general opinion regarding the world?<br />
Answer:<br />
Value Points:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• leading role of baker in society.<br />
• use of different breads and cakes in function and festivals.<br />
• baker greeted by children, not washing mouth, eating bread bangles.<br />
• musical entry.<br />
• prosperous family of baker.<br />
• dress of baker/pader.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
The author tells us that bread is an indispensable part of the life of the Goan people since the time of the Portuguese. Bread is a part of not only everyday life but also of festive occasions and events. For each occasion there was a special kind of bread. He also tells us that the baker had leading role in the society. He was so important in the life of the Goans that they got up with the jingling sound of his bamboo. He also tells us that the baker wore either a Kabai, i.e., a long frock or a shirt and a half pant like trousers.<br />
The author seems to be very observant because not only does he knows all this but also knows the profit-making in it as he says that in those days, the baker was very prosperous and never starved. He also knew that they maintained monthly bills on the walls. Such strong observation powers would definitely be beneficial for children as they would become aware citizens of their neighbourhood.</p>

Fire stands for fury, desire, lust, anger, avarice, cruelty greed. Ice is symbolic of hatred, coldness, rigidity, insensitivity and intolerance. The general opinion regarding the world is that the world will end in fire and some say ice. Both the two reasons contrast each other and one equally opposite to each other.

What happened when the Nazis found Anne and her family hiding in the Secret Annexe ? Give a brief description of Anne and her family after the arrest.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>What could be the reasons for intimacy between Anne and Peter ?<br />
Answer:<br />
When Helen was summoned by the investigative body to answer on the charges of plagiarism, she was very distressed. In the beginning, she pleaded innocence and assured that she could not recall Miss Canby’s ’The Frost Fairies’ being read out to her. Miss Sullivan also had not even heard of the book called ’Birdie and his Friends’. Later, it was found that Ms. Sophie had read many books to Helen in Anne’s absence. On the other hand, Mr. Anagnos thought that Helen and Miss Sullivan copied someone else’s stories to impress him.<br />
She found that irrespective of her explanations, the committee had already decided that Helen had copied the ’Frost King’ from Miss Margaret T. Canby’s ’Frost Fairies’. That had frightened Keller so much that she refused to resume writing. Even while writing letters to her mother, she would double-check them to ensure that each and every word or expression was her own creation. She was very upset and got many consolances. Even Miss Canby kindly sent her a letter. But still that was a black cloud in Helen’s garden of childhood.</p>

Helen was quite bitter and’ disappointed to discover that horse shoe crab had vanished. But later she felt that it was good as perhaps he had returned to the sea to which he belonged. She felt that it was wrong on others part to keep him away from his natural habitat and was not a wise move to keep him away of water. This shows that Helen was kind and sensitive towards Crthers even towards animals. She had a sense of wisdom and felt happy when others were happy.</p>

<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Anne and Peter Van Daan lived in the annexe and had no other friends as they were in the hiding. Gradually, both of them got attracted towards each other. Peter was a shy boy who did not share his feelings with anyone. Anne felt that he was nice but suffered from inferiority complex. With the passage of time, Anne grew a likeness for him. Both of them used to meet in the attic. Whenever he was nowhere around, Anne used to long for his company. She loved him but did not convey it to him. They spent good times sitting in the attic, appreciating nature. However, Anne felt guilty in meeting him secretly and shared her secret with her father.
