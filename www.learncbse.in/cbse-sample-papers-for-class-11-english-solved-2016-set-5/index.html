<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8) </strong><br />
Depression is a common problem of modern times. Both the rich and poor suffer from it. According to the World Health Organisation, by the year 2020, depression will become the second leading cause of disease in the world. Many solutions have been prescribed for the problem of depression but most have proved to be ineffective as a complete cure. They may offer temporary relief but fail to resolve the problem permanently.<br />
Meditation is often advised to treat this problem of depression. But meditation focuses on the heart and modern science has established that the heart is merely an organ that pumps blood, whereas many kinds of depression stem from the mind. It is the mind that controls the heart and not vice versa. In many cases, depression is non-physical and the heart is physical. How can a physical organ resolve a non-physical problem?<br />
We also often hear about physical techniques to counter depression. But the reach of physical techniques is confined to the body and does not extend to the mind.<br />
Many kinds of depression are the result of non-acceptance of reality. The real solution to this problem is then acceptance of reality. While non-acceptance creates the problem, acceptance of reality will solve it.<br />
Our world is one of freedom, competition, challenge and clash of interests. This nature of human life is bound to create problems. No one is exempted from this process. This being so, to de-stress, learn the art of stress management rather than trying to eliminate the stress.<br />
A person may become sad upon facing a loss in business or feeling discriminated against at work. He may give in to anxiety and frustration if he sufers a loss in an election, his love marriage turns into a problem marriage or if he is offended by criticism. In all such cases, a person becomes negative because of being unaware of the real cause. He attributes the cause to another person and holds this person responsible for his difficulties. He fails to realise that all these are due to the law of nature. If you attribute the cause of the problem to the divine law of nature, it will arouse no negativity, but when you attribute it to a person, it brings on negative thinking. This is because the law of nature is not your rival, whereas you see a person as your competitor. When you attribute the cause of your problem to a rival, it will invariably arouse negative thoughts and cause anger. But when you attribute the cause to the law of nature, because it is not your rival and is equal in its treatment of all, it will lead to introspection.<br />
When you follow nature-based thinking instead of man-based thinking, you will try to discover its wisdom and will realise that whatever has happened is for your betterment. It was to activate your mind and enhance its creativity. It was a means of developing a realistic approach, fostering incentive, making you realise your mistake and helping you to re-plan practically. When this thought comes to you, your mind will automatically change from negative to positive. You will be grateful towards the law of nature for bestowing this blessing in disguise. This thought will eliminate your stress and you will be able to live normally. This is a good way to help de-stress the mind.<br />
<strong>(a) On the basis of your reading of the above passage, makes notes on it using</strong><br />
<strong> headings and sub-headings. Use recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary (minimum 4). Supply a suitable title to it.(5)</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Write a summary of the above passage in about 80-100 words. (3)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.(12)</strong><br />
I was lucky- I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parent’s garage when I was 20. We worked hard and in 10 years Apple had grown into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation -the Macintosh- a year earlier and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company and for the first year or so things went well. But then eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating.<br />
I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down-that. I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. But something slowly began to dawn on me -1 still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.<br />
I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love.<br />
<strong>(a) On the basis of your reading of the passage, answer the following questions by</strong><br />

<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8) </strong>Depression is a common problem of modern times. Both the rich and poor suffer from it. According to the World Health Organisation, by the year 2020, depression will become the second leading cause of disease in the world. Many solutions have been prescribed for the problem of depression but most have proved to be ineffective as a complete cure. They may offer temporary relief but fail to resolve the problem permanently.<br />
Meditation is often advised to treat this problem of depression. But meditation focuses on the heart and modern science has established that the heart is merely an organ that pumps blood, whereas many kinds of depression stem from the mind. It is the mind that controls the heart and not vice versa. In many cases, depression is non-physical and the heart is physical. How can a physical organ resolve a non-physical problem?<br />
We also often hear about physical techniques to counter depression. But the reach of physical techniques is confined to the body and does not extend to the mind.<br />
Many kinds of depression are the result of non-acceptance of reality. The real solution to this problem is then acceptance of reality. While non-acceptance creates the problem, acceptance of reality will solve it.<br />
Our world is one of freedom, competition, challenge and clash of interests. This nature of human life is bound to create problems. No one is exempted from this process. This being so, to de-stress, learn the art of stress management rather than trying to eliminate the stress.<br />
A person may become sad upon facing a loss in business or feeling discriminated against at work. He may give in to anxiety and frustration if he sufers a loss in an election, his love marriage turns into a problem marriage or if he is offended by criticism. In all such cases, a person becomes negative because of being unaware of the real cause. He attributes the cause to another person and holds this person responsible for his difficulties. He fails to realise that all these are due to the law of nature. If you attribute the cause of the problem to the divine law of nature, it will arouse no negativity, but when you attribute it to a person, it brings on negative thinking. This is because the law of nature is not your rival, whereas you see a person as your competitor. When you attribute the cause of your problem to a rival, it will invariably arouse negative thoughts and cause anger. But when you attribute the cause to the law of nature, because it is not your rival and is equal in its treatment of all, it will lead to introspection.<br />
When you follow nature-based thinking instead of man-based thinking, you will try to discover its wisdom and will realise that whatever has happened is for your betterment. It was to activate your mind and enhance its creativity. It was a means of developing a realistic approach, fostering incentive, making you realise your mistake and helping you to re-plan practically. When this thought comes to you, your mind will automatically change from negative to positive. You will be grateful towards the law of nature for bestowing this blessing in disguise. This thought will eliminate your stress and you will be able to live normally. This is a good way to help de-stress the mind.<br />

<strong>(b) Summary</strong><br />
Depression is a common problem of modem times : WHO expects it to become the second leading cause of disease in the world. Prescribed solutions offer temporary relief but offer no permanent solution. Acceptance of reality and learning the art of stress management are the solutions to cure the problem of depression. Attributing another person as the cause of any problem causes stress. We should attribute problems to the divine law of nature and follow nature based thinking. This is a means of developing a realistic approach and eliminating stress.<br />
<strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.(12)</strong><br />
I was lucky- I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parent’s garage when I was 20. We worked hard and in 10 years Apple had grown into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees. We had just released our finest creation -the Macintosh- a year earlier and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired. How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew, we hired someone who I thought was very talented to run the company and for the first year or so things went well. But then eventually we had a falling out. When we did, our Board of Directors sided with him. So at 30 I was out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone and it was devastating.<br />
I really didn’t know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down-that. I had dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. But something slowly began to dawn on me -1 still loved what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love. And so I decided to start over.<br />
I didn’t see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life. During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar. Pixar went on to create the world’s first computer animated feature film, Toy Story and is now the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple’s current renaissance. I’m pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn’t been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess the patient needed it. Sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick. Don’t lose faith. I’m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You’ve got to find what you love.<br />

I want to draw the attention of the Municipal Corporation of North Delhi to the harm being caused to the aquatic life of Naini Lake. To attract the visitors, a adventure sports like boating water skiing etc have, started on the lake due to which the aquatic life in the lake is diminishing with each passing day.<br />
Earlier the lake was full of beautiful species of fishes, frogs, tortoises and the small sand area had flamingo birds too. But what now is left is the litter and garbage left by visitors. Moreover the lake now has a pungent smell.<br />
The guards present are least bothered about the problem. Despite many complaints to the local authorities, no action has been taken so far. I request the Municipal Corporation of Delhi to arrange to rectify the situation as soon as possible.<br />

<strong>Ans.  </strong>                         <strong> Keep up the Spirit of the Polio Campaign</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Kanishka Chhabra</p>
<p>The Polio Campaign is an excellent example to prove that if there is a will, there is a way. Earlier, India topped the chart of patients suffering from polio. But, because of strong determination, hard work and an efficient campaign, polio was eradicated from the country within a short span of time. A disease which was once an epidemic and took lives of several children, got wiped out from India. This was due to the spirit of the campaign. Sadly, after achieving the desired goals, the campaign is being ignored, it seems. Earlier famous actor Amitabh Bachan was rigorously involved in electronic media who urged people to get the polio vaccinations done. Awareness was spread through print and other sources of media. Now, there are no such advertisements. In fact today people hardly get to know about the dates of polio vaccination, because of which their children miss the essential medicines.<br />
Therefore, both the State and Central Governments should ensure the appropriate and obligatory working of this campaign, as we all know that polio is a contagious disease. It can come back if not tackled properly and India will fall back from where it is now.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Misconduct of the School Library Staff</strong></p>
<p>As an avid reader, I am regular visitor of my school library. Last Monday when I went to the library to return some books, I was surprised at what happened. Books were lying in a haphazard manner on tables. They were not in their prescribed shelf and more than 50 books were lying on the teacher’s desk. When I asked for help, the staff talked to me very rudely. I found it very awkward, as it was the first time I was talked to like this. When I went to the library incharge, she literally threw a book towards me and looked as if students were a headache.<br />
I returned, but later I found that the library staff had a dispute with the teaching staff, because of which they directed their anger toward students. I feel that the library staff should be respected and this issue must be resolved by the intervention of some senior person. I hope that this matter is resolved soon so that students do not suffer.</p>

<strong>(ii) What does the statement, &#8220;forests precede mankind; deserts follow&#8221; mean?</strong><br />
<strong> (iii) How do you know that the Garoghlanian tribe was very poor</strong><br />
<strong>(iv) Why did Mrs Dorling refuse to even talk to the narrator?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Tut’s body was buried along with gilded treasures because at that time the royals were wealthy and they thought and hoped that they could take their riches with them in their journey to the greater beyond. Hence, Tut was buried with all the things that he used in his daily life and the things that he would need in the afterlife.<br />
(ii) Forests are one of the principal biological systems of the Earth. They form the foundation of the global economic system. It is true that if forests disappear, deserts will follow.<br />
Forests were in existence much before the coming of man on this planet. Local forests are disappearing to provide firewood and wood. The world is losing 40 to 50 million acres of forests a year. If this process continues, nothing will be left except deserts and wastelands.<br />
(iii) The Garoghlanian tribe was poor. Every branch of the tribal family was living in the most amazing and comical poverty in the world. Nobody could understand where they ever got enough money to keep themselves away from hunger.<br />
(iv) Mrs Dorling had all the precious belongings of the narrator’s family. Even the green cardigan that she was wearing belonged to the author’s mother. She was shocked to see the narrator as she thought that no one had returned after the war. Mrs Dorling understood that the narrator wants her belongings back. She had no intention of returning them. Therefore, she showed no sign of recognition and refused to talk to the narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>11. Answer the following questions in 120-150 words.</strong><br />
<strong>Compare and contrast the values which Mrs S and Mrs Dorling possess. (6</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>Give your opinion on child marriages in light of the chapter, ‘Ranga&#8217;s Marriage&#8217;. Do you think it harms the mental well being of a child?  (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Mrs S, was the mother of the narrator, was a very simple lady. She would trust anyone blindly. During the first half of the war, Mrs S feared that she would lose everything if they have to leave their home in an emergency. So, she found an old acquaintance, Mrs Dorling, who would take care of her belongings. Mrs S trusted her friend completely. She gave to her all the precious and valuable things that she had. The narrator asked her mother about Mrs Dorling, as she was neither sure about the lady nor about her ideas. At this, Mrs S looked at her reprovingly and they never talked about it thereafter.<br />
All this shows us that Mrs S was a gem of a person, unlike Mrs Dorling, who deceived her and betrayed her trust. Mrs Dorling took advantage of their helpless situation and behaved inhumanly.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Ours is a traditional society. Though it is good to hold on to your beliefs and traditions, blindly following adamant practices can cause harm. Such is the case with child marriages. The evil of child marriages has been surviving since ages.<br />
The narrator in the chapter ‘Ranga’s Marriage’ tried to bring out the flaws of such an association. Young children are not mature enough to carry out the responsibilities that come with marriage. They are not even able to take care of themselves.<br />
Marital relationships require a lot of maturity and understanding. These qualities develop only after a certain age and childhood is meant to learn, study, play and grow. Education plays an important role in creating awareness and we can notice that educated people don&#8217;t even think about getting married till they are settled financially and emotionally ready to get married.</p>

<p><strong>12. How did the third appearance of the ghost act upon himself ?</strong><br />
<strong>(The Canterville Ghost)   (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>What kind of problems did the narrator face in West Virginia? (Up From Slavery) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> It was on 17th August that the ghost appeared in a dead man’s shroud and reached Washington’s room at first. But as he turned, he faced another ghost standing in front of him. It also carried a hanging placard in front. Never having seen a Ghost before, the Canterville Ghost was terribly shocked and fled back to his room. He then decided to approach his fellow ghost after some time. However, when he reached there he found the ghost to be a fake one. He realised that he had been tricked, as the false ghost was made up of white bed curtain, a kitchen cleaner and a hollow turnip. As he tried to hold its arm, its head rolled on one side. Once again the Canterville Ghost had been fooled.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Life in West Virginia was difficult for the Booker family or any other slave. The new house was no better than the one they had left on the old plantation. In fact, it was even worse. There was no scope of fresh air. Their new home was in the midst of a cluster of cabins crowded closely together and, as there were no sanitary regulations, the filth about the cabins was often intolerable. Apart from the poverty and squalor, drinking, gambling, quarrels, fights and shockingly immoral practices were frequent.<br />
Here their neighbours were coloured people and some of the poorest and most ignorant and degraded white people. All who lived in this little town were in one way or another connected with the salt business. The narrator, too, got a job at a salt-furnace and his work started as early as four O’clock in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>13. What message does the novel, &#8216;The Canterville Ghost&#8217; bring out?</strong><br />
<strong>(The Canterville Ghost)   (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>Why did the narrator fear working in a coal mine? (Up From Slavery)                   (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> The story begins with the moving of Mr Otis’ family to Canterville Chase, despite receiving warning from Lord Canterville that the house is haunted. The ghost’s attempts to appear in his most successful gruesome guises and the re-appearing bloodstains on the floor just by the fireplace are in vain. The ghost, becomes a victim to the twins pranks and the Otis family succeeds in foiling him every time. It is only to Virginia that the ghost exposes his vulnerability. Virginia takes him seriously and weeps for him. She prays for the fallen soul of sir Simon. As Virginia prays to the Angel of Death and helps Sir Simon to pass on to the next world, she gradually comes to realise the grave truth of life, the true meaning of love as a strong power over both life and death. The message is reflected in Virginia’s self-realisation and prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>The narrator feared working in a coal mine because such a workman was always unclean and it was a hard job to get one’s skin clean after the day’s work was over. The mines were filthy and engulfed in darkness. A mine was divided into a large number of different ‘rooms’ or departments and he was never able to learn the location of all these rooms and often got lost in the mine. Sometimes the light would go out and he would wonder about in the darkness till he found someone to give him a light. The work was also dangerous. There was always a danger of being blown to pieces by a premature explosion of powder or of being crushed by falling slate. He noticed that boys in coal mines were often ’physically and mentally dwarfed’. They soon lost ambition to do anything else.</p>
