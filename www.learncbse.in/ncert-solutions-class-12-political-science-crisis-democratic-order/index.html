<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> ‘The 1977 elections for the first time saw the opposition coming to power at the centre’. Examine any six reasons for this change.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The 1977 elections were evolved as a shock to everyone as Congress Party was defeated for the very first time and opposition party came into power:<br />
1. The opposition adopted the slogan ‘save democracy’ against imposition of emergency earlier.<br />
2. The opposition campaigned non- democratic character of rule which provided various excesses.<br />
3. The opposition party highlighted the preventive detention and press censorship to favour public opinion.<br />
4. Janata Party also ensured not to divide non-Congress votes.<br />
5. Middle section of North India was moving away from Congress for whom Janata Party became a platform.<br />
6. Hence, elections of 1977 emerged many other factors instead about emergency only.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>5. Explain any three outcomes of Lok Sabha elections of 1977.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> 1. In March 1977 elections, for the first time, Congress lost elections with winning 154 seats only.<br />
2. Janata Party and its allies won 330 seats out of 542 seats.<br />
3. Congress lost from the states of Bihar, U.P., Haryana, Delhi and Madhya Pradesh.<br />
4. Janata Party was formed of coalitions under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayana.<br />
5. Janata Party called this election as a referendum on emergency.<br />
6. Opposition party realised not to divide the votes to enjoy the power under one umbrella.<br />
7. All these indicated a tough time for Congress ahead.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>6. What is Naxalite movement? Evaluate its role in Indian politics.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The Naxalites were the Marxist and Leninist agricultural workers of Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and adjoining areas which organised massive agilations against economic injustice and inequality and demanded redistribution of land to cultivators.<br />
Role in Indian Politics:<br />
1. Naxalite, did not participate in the elections formally but these were actively associated with parties.<br />
2. Naxalites ensured a better representation of demands of deprived social sections in party politics.<br />
3. These movements retained associations or relations alongwith the political parties either as an individual or as an organisations.</p>
