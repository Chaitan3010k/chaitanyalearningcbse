(h) Why was Harold upset that his father had not told him about his true identity? Give two reasons.<br />
(i) Do you agree with Harold’s parents decision of hiding from him the fact that his father was a boxer? Why/Why not?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Harold didn’t like the manner in which Mrs. Bramble addressed her son. Nor did he relish the habit of his mother of referring to herself in the third person. She spoke as if she were addressing a baby. She would never use “I” but said, “Yes, mother will hear you, precious”. Now Harold was a young man of ten. He had already won the spelling and dictation prize to his credit. He felt bad about it.</p>
<p>(b) Harold was very different from ordinary children. Harold’s parents wanted to keep Mr. Bramble’s profession a well guarded secret from him. Harold was made to believe the fiction that his father was a commercial traveller. They didn’t want Harold to die of ‘disgrace’ by knowing the truth that his father was a man of ‘wrath’ and a bloody boxer.</p>
<p>(c) Mr. Bramble was a famous boxer. When he came to know that he was to become a father he had many names in his mind for his child. All of them were related to the world of boxing. He wanted his child to be named John, if a boy, after Mr. John L. Sullivan or if a girl, Marie, after Miss Marie Lloyd. But he had to sacrifice his choice when his wife opposed him.</p>
<p>(d) Mr. Bramble was an ‘excellent man’ and nobody ‘could help liking him’. He was a professional boxer better known as ‘Young Porky’. There was not a boxer in London whom he could not overcome in a twenty- round contest. He was famous for his left hook. But he was a very considerate, self- sacrificing and diffident character. He could sacrifice his name, fame and money as a boxer not to ‘disgrace’ Harold.</p>
<p>(e) Mrs. Bramble didn’t like professional boxing. Nor did she want Harold to know that his father was ‘Young Porky’. But she was upset when she came to hear that Bill had decided not to fight. Big money was involved in the fighting. The winner was to get 500 pounds and even the loser was to get 120 pounds. Boxing had earned good money for the family and made possible to give Harold a good education. That money could give Harold a better start in life than they had ever had.</p>
<p>(f) Mr. Jerry Fisher was a boxing coach or trainer at the White Hart. He was a hard trainer. Bill’s fight with Jimmy Murphy was going to be a national affair. He was proud of Bill and was sure of his victory. He was shocked to know that Bill had given up the idea of fighting. He tried to convince Bill to change his mind. He reminded him of the handsome money that he would get by participating in the fight.</p>
<p>(g) Jerry Fisher disliked Bill now and he wanted to take revenge. The best way of taking revenge was to disclose Bill’s real identity to his son Harold. He disclosed that Bill was not a commercial traveller but a professional boxer, popularly known as ‘Young Porky’.</p>
<p>(h) When Harold came to know that his father was actually ‘Young Porky’, he was upset. He realised that he had been deprived of the honour of being the son of ‘Young Porky’. His schoolmates wouldn’t dare to call him ‘goggles’ if they knew that ‘Young Porky’ was his father. He had already betted two shillings that Jimmy Murphy would not last ten rounds against ‘Young Porky.’</p>
<p>(i) Harold’s parents’ decision of hiding from him the fact that his father was a boxer was not correct. They thought that Harold would die of disgrace if he came to know that his father was a man of wrath and called ‘Young Porky’. The truth was the other way around. Harold was deeply interested in boxing. He had betted two shillings that Jimmy Murphy would not last ten rounds against ‘Young Porky’. It was a dramatic irony that his parents hid from him the fact of which he could swank like anything.</p>

<p>Writing Task<br />
Question 8.<br />
Many people are of the opinion that violent, physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing and wrestling, to name a few should be banned while others think otherwise.<br />
Express your opinion on the topic by either writing in favour of banning these sports or against banning them. While writing, you should also include the rebuttal to your questions. Try not to go beyond 200 words.<br />
Answer:<br />
<strong>BANNING VIOLENT PHYSICAL SPORTS</strong><br />
Many people think that violent physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing, wrestling, bull-fighting, to name a few, should be banned. And they think rightly so. What’s the main aim of sports and games? Pleasure and entertainment. They provide us thrill or ‘excitement’. They lift our spirits. We feel more animated and alive. And the entertainment that sports and games provide us is the healthy and wholesome entertainment. On the other hand, violent physical sports such as boxing, kick boxing and bullfighting provide us a vulgar pleasure. It is violent and sadistic in nature. When we watch hockey, badminton or cricket we enjoy them. We appreciate Gavaskar for defence, Vivian Richards for attack and Sachin Tendulkar for style. Similarly, we adore Maradona or Pele not for their foul play or hitting the opponents but for their scoring abilities. Similarly, we admire Federer for his craftsmanship and Nadal for his power play in lawn-tennis. All these sports lift us physically, mentally as well as spiritually.</p>
<p>Watch a ten or fifteen-round boxing match. What do you like the most in a boxing match? You like the punches, hooks and the maximum damage that a boxer can do to his opponent. At every punch or hook your desire to see assault and your blood is aroused. Before the bout ends you find both the players wounded, bleeding and their faces cut at more than half a dozen places. Some players even lose their lives during boxing bouts. What is bullfighting? It shows sheer lack of decency, lack of good taste that one craves for such violent sports. Such bloody and violent sports should be banned.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
A large part of the story is composed of conversation between the characters.<br />
Can you convert it into a play and in groups, present your version of the play before the class? Before that, decide onthe members of cast, minimum props required and also the costumes.<br />

<p><strong>Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow:</strong><br />
Question 1.<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
The only drawback was that his very ‘perfection’ had made necessary a series of evasions and even deliberate falsehoods on the part of herself and her husband, highly distasteful to both.

<p>Question 4.<br />
So, Harold grew in stature and intelligence, without a suspicion of the real identity of the<br />
square-jawed man with the irregularly-shaped nose who came and went mysteriously in their semi-detached, red-brick home. He was a self-centred child, and, accepting the commercial traveller fiction, dismissed the subject from his mind and busied himself with things of more moment. (Page 31)<br />

(b) Who was ‘the square-jawed man’?<br />

(a) Who is snubbing Percy?<br />

(b) He is afraid of his publicity.<br />
(c) ‘Keeping It From Harold.’</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
“How about the money?” Repeated Mrs. Bramble. “Goodness knows I’ve never liked your profession, Bill, but there is this to be said for it, that it’s earned you good money and made it possible for us to give Harold as good an education as any duke ever had, I’m sure. (Page 33)<br />
(a) What is Bill’s profession?<br />
(b) What gave good money to the Brambles?<br />
(c) Write the verb form of ‘education’.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Professional boxing is Bill’s profession.<br />
(b) Bill’s professional boxing gave good money to the Brambles.<br />
(c) Educate.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
“Tommy,” said Mr. Fisher, ignoring them all, “you think your Pa’s a commercial. He ain’t. He’s a fighting-man, doing his eight-stone-four ringside, and known to all the heads as ‘Young Porky.’” (Page 37)<br />

(c) Here ‘ain’t’ stands for ‘is not’. It also stands for ‘am not’ and ‘are not’.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
How long do you suppose they’d go on calling me, ‘Goggles’ if they knew that you were my father? They’d chuck it tomorrow, and look up to me like anything, I do call ilrotten. (Page 38)<br />

(b) Harold is the speaker.<br />
(c) Bill’s idea of withdrawing from the contest is ‘rotten’ in the eyes of the speaker.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Pa, can’t you give me a picture of yourself boxing? I could swank like anything. And you don’t know how sick a chap gets of having chaps call him, ‘Goggles.’ (Page 38)<br />
(a) The speaker wants to swank. Why?<br />
(b) Why does the speaker feel sick?<br />

(b) Harold feels sick because he is called ‘Goggles’ by his classmates.<br />

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ABOUT THE STORY</strong></span></p>
<p>‘Keeping It from Harold’ conveys the idea that it is wrong to undervalue anything which involves physical skills such as boxing, wrestling, etc. while overestimating intellectual activities. Both Mr Bramble and Mrs Bramble are proud of a child prodigy, Mr Bramble is a famous boxer known as ‘Young Porky’. He and his wife come to believe that they should hide from their son the fact of his father being a boxer. They feel that Harold will hate his father. They are encouraged in this wrong belief by the senior curate of the parish and Major Percy Stokes (Mrs Bramble’s brother). Mr Bramble was proud of his being a boxer before the birth of his son. The trainer JLerry Fisher, in anger at his refusal to fight, discloses the secret to Harold. Harold surprises them when he tells them that he is not ashamed of but angry with his father who has refused to fight and defeat his opponent Murphy. Harold feels satisfied when his father gets ready to go with his trainer to prepare himself for the great fight.</p>

</strong>Like all mothers, Mrs Bramble is excessively fond of her son, Harold. She is very loving and caring. She addresses her son as ‘dearie’ and refers to herself in the third person. She is also convinced that Harold should not know that his father is a boxer. She is a good housewife. She manages the house well. She feels upset when she learns that her husband has refused to fight. She feels that if he does not fight they will have no money essential for their son’s education and bright future.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Harold<br />
</strong>Harold is a model child, different from ordinary children. He is fully devoted to his books. He is a model of good behaviour. Everybody admires him. He has already won prizes in academics. His parents are in awe of him. His parents are unaware of the fact that he is interested in boxing and knows a lot about the game and boxers. He surprises his parents by expressing his anger that he has not been told that his father is a famous boxer. He proves them wrong. He feels proud of his father and his profession. He wants his father to fight and defeat his opponent, Murphy.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 10:</span></strong><br />
Who was Jerry Fisher ? What did he say to try and convince Bill to change his mind ? <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Jerry Fisher was the trainer of Bill Bramble. He was angry with Bill for deciding not to fight. He tried to convince him that he would earn a lot of money if he fought. He said he should also think of all the troubles he had gone through to earn name and fame as a boxer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 11:</span></strong><br />
What was it that Harold did not like about his mother ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Mrs Bramble treated her grown-up child, Harold, as a kid. She would call him ‘dearie’. She would refer to herself in the third person. Harold did not like this strange way of talking to him. He often felt bad and irritated about it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 12:</span></strong><br />
When Mr Bramble came to know that he was to become a father what were some of the names he decided upon ? Why ?<br />

Mr Bramble thought about the names of famous sports persons for his child. He wanted to name his child John, if a boy, after Mr John L Sullivan, or if a girl, Marie, after Miss Marie Lloyd. It was so because he wanted his child to earn name and fame as a sportsperson.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 13:</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 14:</span></strong><br />

<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />

What tells you of Harold’s interest in boxing ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 16:</span></strong><br />
Do you agree with Harold’s parents’ decision of hiding from him the fact that his father was a boxer ? Why/Why not ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
No, the decision was wrong. There is no shame in being a sportsperson or a boxer. Every physical activity is as dignified as any intellectual activity. Harold’s parents should not have hidden the fact of his father’s profession. There was nothing shameful about it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 17:</span></strong><br />
Harold was a model child but for one thing that marred his ‘perfe ction’. What was it ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />

<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 18:</span></strong><br />
Why did Harold’s parents think it prudent to keep him in dark about his father’s profession ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Harold’s parents thought that boxing did not enjoy good reputation, and that being a professional boxer was not something to be proud of. They feared their child would feel ashamed of himself if he learnt that his father was a boxer.</p>

Name the two persons who were mainly responsible for keeping Harold in dark about his father’s true identity.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
The senior curate of the parish and Mrs Bramble’s brother, Major Percy Stokes, were mainly responsible for convincing Harold’s parents not to disclose the true identity of his father to him as they believed that boxing was not a respectable profession.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 20:</span></strong><br />
Was Mr Bramble ashamed of his profession ? Why did he agree to the suggestion that he should conceal his professional identity from his son ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Mr Bramble had been proud of being a professional boxer before the birth of Harold. He was the most obliging of men. When he was asked to suppress his profession for the better development of his child, he agreed to the suggestion without demur.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>VALUE &#8211; BASED LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (SOLVED)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Answer the following questions in 80-100 words each.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />
One should take pride in one’s profession. Comment upon the<br />
statement in the context of the story ‘Keeping It from Harold’.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Are Mrs and Mr Bramble justified in not taking pride in their profession. Do you agree ?<br />
Give reasons for your answer. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
You should really take pride in your profession. Only then can others give you respect and recognition. Those who look down upon their profession remain guilt-ridden and a failure. In the story ‘Keeping It from Harold’ both Mrs and Mr Bramble are guilty of undermining the profession of boxing. Mr Bramble is a famous boxer, known as “Young Porky’. Uptil his son’s birth he thinks high of his profession. Then both he and his wife come to believe that their son Harold would feel embarrassed and ashamed of the fact that he was the son of a boxer. They keep Mr Bramble’s profession a secret from Harold. They are pleasantly shocked when Harold feels angry at being deprived of the glory and honour of being a famous boxer’s son. This proves that his parents were not justified in downgrading a good profession. Boxing, though an aggressive and bloody game, is an honourable profession like any other profession.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span></strong><br />
Harold is considered to be fond of only intellectual activities. He proves to be much maturer than his parents think. How ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Harold is an intelligent boy who is considered to be a model in studies and behaviour. Everyone at school praises him. He has already won some prizes in academics. He is a bespectacled child. His parents are in a bit of awe of him. His mother, Mrs Bramble, calls him ‘dearie’ and looks upon him as a child prodigy. His father is equally fond and proud of him. His parents come to believe that he should not know that he is the son of a professional boxer. He can never think that he could be a lover of boxing and boxers. When Harold learns about his being the son of a famous boxer, he feels angry of being deprived of glory and honour. He tells his parents that if the fact was known to his school children they would never have dared to make fun of him by calling ‘Goggles’. His interest in games, especially boxing, shows that is much maturer than his parents can ever think of.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span></strong><br />
Jerry Fisher, in his pursuit to unravel the secret that the Brambles had hidden so long from Harold,<br />
actually helped the Bramble family.Discuss. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
The Brambles had not told their son Harold that his father was a professional boxer. They were afraid that Harold would feel bad and bitter about the truth. So they told a lie to him that his father was a firm’s touring representative. Mr Bramble wanted to take part for the last time in a boxing match. He went for training with Jerry Fisher. When he learnt that the match would be reported in the Mail with his photograph he got frightened. He thought that their secret would be out. So he withdrew himself from the training. As they needed money, the matter caused both he and his wife a lot of worry and tension. Jerry Fisher, in anger, revealed their secret to their son Harold. When Harold announced his itnerest in boxing and his feelings of pride in being the son of a boxer, Mr and Mrs Bramble were relieved of their burden and guilt. Thus, Jerry Fisher, in revealing the secret, helped them regain normalcy.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:</span></strong><br />
As Harold, express year feelings in a diary entry in 80-100 words on learning about your father’s profession. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
10th April, 20&#8230;.<br />
10 p.m.<br />
Dear Diary<br />
I am so happy and excited today! I want to dance like mad. Today Jerry Fisher, who is Dad’ trainer (I learnt only today), revealed that Dad is no other that “Young Porky’, a famous boxer. I would not believe my ears. Dad and a boxer ? I had been told that he was a touring representative of a firm, My father was ready to sacrifice name and fame and money just for my so-called dignity. I appreciate his feelings. At the same time I feel sad that I have been deprived of the honour and glory of being the son of a great boxer. I have asked Dad to give me his photograph to swank it before my friends ever ready to make fun of me as ‘Goggles’. I have also asked Dad to fight and beat Murphy. I want him to win the bout at all costs. How I love you, Dad!</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 5:</span></strong><br />
As Major Percy, write a letter to your friend expressing your remorse at your failure to keep Mr Bramble away from a devilish game.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
10 Green House Susse<br />
4th April, 20&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Dear John<br />
I wish I were dead this moment. You know, I am deadly against boxing which is a Devil’s game. Boxing is simply inhuman. I believe boxers are fated to go to Hell. I did my best to save Mr Bramble, my sister’s husband, from perdition. I was happy when Mr Bramble came back home deciding not to participate in the bout with Jimmy Murphy. My sister resented his coming home. I tried to persuade her to see reason and forget the money involved. Then Jerry Fisher-Mr Bramble’s trainer-undid all that I had done. He told the secret to Harold, and Harold-God save him-was so exultant on knowing that he was the son of a boxer! How mean on his part.<br />
I’ve decided never to step in the house of those Brambles.<br />
Yours sincerely Percy</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 6:</span></strong><br />
‘Keeping It from Harold’ underlines the idea that boxing is as dignified as any other activity, physical or mental. What happens when we downplay one activity over the other, especially our own ability ? What should be our attitude ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Mr Bramble, a famous boxer, hides his profession from his intellectually brilliant son, fearing that he might come to hate him. He decides to stop boxing.<br />
We feel that when we downplay one activity over the other illogically, we are not doing something fair. If we happen to downplay and dislike our own ability, like Mr Bramble, we are likely to fall in our own eyes. We lose our self-confidence and self-pride. Others may or may not despise us but we begin to despise ourselves. The Brambles are surprised when their son says that he would have loved to be known as the son of a famous boxer.<br />
Therefore, we need to be proud of our own achievements. We should be proud of whatever profession we are in. We should try to excel in it and feel proud of what we do. Only then will other people love and respect us. We should remember that no activity or profession is undignified or low. It is our thinking that makes something desirable or undesirable.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 7:</span></strong><br />
“He was a professional boxer. That was the trouble.” Discuss.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
There are many people who look down upon boxing. They think that sports like boxing are violent and are hence not meant for gentle folk. In the story, such people are represented by the senior curate of the parish and major Percy Stokes who take upon them the responsibility of guarding the morality of the people. They persuade the Brambles to hide from their son Harold the profession of his father. Mr Bramble, who has been a good boxer and known as Young Porky’, comes to believe them. Being modest, he gives in to their demands. In spite of having pride in his profession, he agrees to hide his true identity. He makes this sacrifice for the sake of his son. He wants his son not to feel ashamed of himself for his being a boxer. It is again for the sake of his son that he decides not to take part in the contest with Jimmy Murphy, though he needs money badly. He fears his son will come to know of his father’s true identity as the event is going to be reported in the Mail.</p>
<p>Little does he know that his son is fond of boxing. He has gathered a lot of information about boxing and boxers. When the truth is out, his son is annoyed at being kept in the dark that he is the son of a professional boxer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 8:</span></strong><br />
“Pa, can’t you give me a picture of yourself boxing ? I could swank like anything. And you don’t know how sick a chap gets of having chaps call him, ‘Goggles’.”<br />
In the light of the above extract, analyze Harold’s feeling on learning that his father was a professional boxer.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Harold overheard his father talking about him. He was curious to know what he was talking about. Jerry Fisher, in order to take revenge on Bill, told Harold that his father was not a commercial traveler but the famous boxer ‘Young Porky’, and that his father was not going to fight with Murphy because of him. Harold was astonished to learn the fact. He surprised everyone by revealing that he had a bet and if there were no contest, he was going to lose his bet. He said that his friends had the autographs of famous sport spersons. He felt annoyed that he had been kept in the dark about his father being a boxer. Nobody would have laughed at him and called him ‘Goggles’ if they had known who his father was.</p>
<p>Mr Bramble told Mr Fisher that it would be better for them to go back to the White Hart. After they had left, Harold continued talking about the relative merits of Sid Sampson and the Ginger Nut, the two famous boxers. There was animated expression on his face..</p>
