<p>Question 1.<br />

Kausani is situated at a height of 6,075 feet in the central Himalayas. It is an unusually attractive little town. It covers just about 5.2 sQuestion km. It lies to the north of Almora in Uttarakhand’s picturesque Kumaon region.<br />
Kausani provides the 300 km. wide breathtaking view of the Himalayas. It is the most striking aspect of this place. Snow-capped peaks are spread in a stately row. They stare at you in silvery-white majesty. The most famous peak on view is Nanda Devi, the second highest mountain in India. It is situated at a height of 25,645 feet and 36 miles away as the crow flies. The other famous peaks on view are Choukhamba (23,420 feet) and Trishul (23,360 feet). Then there are also Nilkanth, Nandaghunti, Nandaghat and Nandakot. On a clear day, the blue of the sky makes a splendid background to these peaks. At sunrise and at sunset, when the colour of the sky changes to golden orange, the scene gets etched in your memory.<br />
When Gandhiji visited this place in 1929, its scenic beauty held him spellbound. He named it the ’Switzerland of India’. He prolonged his two days stay to fourteen days, making time to write a book, ’Anashakti Yoga’. The place where he was staying was originally a guest house of a tea estate. It was renamed ’Anashakti Ashram’ after the book.<br />
Kausani is the birthplace of Sumitranandan Pant, India’s poet laureate. Its natural surroundings inspired many of his poems. Its tea gardens mingle with dense pine forests and fruit orchards. The area is also host to many fairs and religious ceremonies. If Uttarakhand is the abode of Gods, Kausani is God’s own backyard. There is no traffic, no one is in a hurry. If serenity could be put on a canvas, the picture would resemble Kausani.<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:<br />
The news paper is one of the significant signs of modem civilization. It is the most popular form of reading in the present times because it interests all sorts of people. It is full of political, news, sports and commercial news, as well as articles by well-known writers. A newspaper keeps us both entertained and informed.<br />
In these days of democracy, public opinion rules everywhere. No government can long withstand the pressure of a strong public opinion. It is, therefore, quite clear that the press controls public opinion, and public opinion in turn controls the government, ultimately the press controls the government. It acts as an interpreter between the government and the people and brings the rulers and the ruled together.<br />
The press also acts as a public court. All evils, corruptions, vices, scandals, etc. are given publicity and brought forth to the public through the medium of newspapers. The pressure of public opinion can be brought to bear upon the doers of evil and injustice. The oppressed and the downtrodden may easily demand justice at the bar of public opinion.<br />
Again, to build a nation, it becomes necessary to spread ideas of liberty and independence among the masses. The real freedom of a country is never possible without the upliftment of the corners people. Politicians as well as economists, can circulate their ideas through newspapers, as they reach the most distant corners in the shortest possible time. Newspapers also tell people what their rights are and teach them how they can protect and exercise their rights. By placing before the readers new view-points every day, they stimulate thought and increase the power of independent thinking. Thus, newspapers contribute to the development of knowledge and their educative influence is indeed immense.<br />
The advantages of having a strong, independent and honest press far outweighs the evils practiced by a few cheap, irresponsible newspapers. The newspaper is one of the greatest blessing of civilization and journalism and therefore, it should be allowed to have the maximum amount of freedom possible.<br />
Restriction on newspaper should be as few as possible in order to ensure the healthy growth of a nation. In the present stage of developing civilization, newspapers are an absolute necessity and give freedom of expression, they are capable of doing immense good to society, the country and the world.

<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Subject: Rising Prices<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to express my deep concern regarding the rising prices. This inflation has made the life of a common man very difficult. The worst hit are the fixed income groups like the salaried people, labour class and the pensioners. For them, even the commodities of basic necessities like wheat, pulses, grains, vegetables etc are getting out of reach. Every increase in price disturbs their budget.<br />
The government should tackle this problem in the best possible way. The hoarders, black marketers and profiters should be dealt with severity. The public distribution system of rationing should be made more transparent and efficient. Moreover, taxes on basic necessities should be reduced to bring down the contrast between the wholesale and the retail prices. The policy decision makers should always keep the layman in mind while making and executing policies.<br />
Thanking you.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Praneeta.</p>

Importance of Education in Personality Development<br />
By: Manish<br />
Everybody wants a good personality but it can’t be made in an eye’s blink. It needs time, patience and hardwork. You need to nourish yourself, physically and mentally. You need to put in positivity in your mind. To get all these things done, there is a major instrument, i.e., Education. Education is necessary for a person’s physical, mental and social development. It shapes his personality as well as develops discipline in his life. To develop personality, a person needs knowledge. He also needs experiences and opportunities. He needs to be disciplined. When he’ll mix in all these, the magic portion of his personality will be developed. And for getting all these, he needs to get education first. Without education, it is next to impossible to achieve all that. Professional and Vocational education imparts skill in the person and a skillful person becomes confident. Through co-curricular activities, moral and ethical values are incorporated in the students which are the utmost need of the present time.<br />
Education teaches him good manners and hence develops his personality to be a responsible and productive citizen.</p>

It was a Sunday afternoon. We had gone for a picnic to a park. Suddenly I found that my seven year old sister was missing from the group. We went in search of her in the woods and &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Answer:<br />
Generally, with the examination round the corner, the stress level of both the wards and the parents are high and sometimes, it reaches the breaking point. The same thing happened with me but the picture was different with my parents. The date of my examination was declared. I was horrified to think of the board examination. Just like other students of my class, it was also my first experience of appearing in the board exam. But I am blessed with such supportive parents who not only counselled me but also helped me in preparing for the exams in the right way. They knew my capability and didn’t burden me with their unrealistic expectations, nor did they draw unnecessary comparisons with other children. Rather they helped me to make schedule for my studies and I followed it seriously. My father helped me in my studies also. My mother took good care of my diet and other chores. All that care and my proper preparation made me feel less stressed. The day of my first exam came. It was maths paper. I reached the examination centre twenty minutes before the scheduled time. I looked for my Roll number and room number, on the board placed there. After getting settled on my seat, I prayed to God. Then the bell rang. Papers were distributed. As soon as I saw the paper, my joy knew no boundaries because the paper seemed very easy to me as I had practiced the course a lot. It made me confident Same happened in all the exams. After commencement of exams, I took a sigh of relief. The time for the result arrived. I stood first in the class. All that happened by the dint of my hard work and due to the support of my parents.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>&#8230; Found her nowhere. We shouted her name at the maximum pitch but to no avail. My mother started weeping after calling her name. Our voice echoed and returned to us. We became very afraid and prayed to God to help us in finding her. Suddenly, we heard trumpet of elephants. It made us sure of some mishappening with her. After a few moments, we saw an elephant running inside the forest. My brother advised us to follow the beast. We did so. What we saw there was beyond any explanation. As we followed that elephant, we saw that animal filling its trunk with water from a pond in that forest. Without making any noise and holding our breath, we waited for its next<br />
action. Then the elephant hurriedly went to a place and sprinkled all that water on somebody and aired with its large ears. And to our surprise and terror, it was none other than my sister who was lying there unconscious. As soon as water was sprinkled over her face, she became conscious and sat up. On seeing all of us, she came running to us. When we asked her how had she reached there, she told that outside the picnic spot, she had seen that elephant. As all of us werebusy in merry-making, she quietly came out and gave some eatables to that animal. Then it became friendly with her.<br />
She sat on its back and reached there. But on hearing its trumpet in the woods, she realized that she was separated from the group and got fainted. We felt ourselves lucky to meet the angel in that beast. [CBSE Marking Scheme, 2016] 10</p>

20th Jan, 2013 Dear Poko,<br />
Hope you are hale and hearty. This year is not going to be so good for me as the last one. The rains have ruined all my harvest. We have nothing to eat. So, I thought of writing a letter to God and asked him to send 100 pesos. And do you know Poko, I got the money but not the amount I had asked for. Thirty pesos were missing. I have doubt on the post-office employees. I wrote to God again and requested for the remaining money. I’m sure he will definitely send the money again.<br />
I’m waiting for a reply from God.<br />

Detailed Answer:<br />
Education is one of the most critical areas of empowerment for women. Offering girls basic education is one sure way of giving them much greater power of enabling them to make genuine choices over the kinds of lives they wish to lead. This is exactly what happened with Bholi. It brought such a transformation that absolutely changed the quality of her life. At first, Bholi had agreed to marry an old man because of her father’s honour, thereby placing her family’s interest over her own. However, later she refused to marry him because she saw how mean, greedy and contemptible he was. By demanding a hefty dowry, Bishamber took advantage of her bad looks and the desperateness of her father to get her married. But courageous Bholi took bold step. Very boldly she rejected the marriage and silenced everybody who called her shameless.</p>

<p>Anne called 26lh July ’A Tumultous Day’. Explain.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Justify the title ’The Diary Of A Young Girl’.<br />
Answer:<br />
In her 1903 autobiography, The Story of My Lite, Helen Keller mentioned about her love of the country and outdoor sports like sailing and canoeing. She enjoyed them the most in moonlights. As a student of Wright-Humson School, she had taken riding lessons. Camping trips, walks in a fragrant garden, and spins on her tandem bicycle were among her favourite outdoor activities. But even more enjoyable to Keller was rowing in her canoe. In fact, she learnt swimming and rowing when she was very young and practically lived in her canoe during the summers as an adult. Nothing gave her greater pleasure than to take her friends out for rowing. She found pleasure in rowing by the scent of water grass and lilies, and of bushes that grow on the shore. She would know the resistance of water when the oars were evenly poised and would tell when she would pull against the current. She liked to contend with wind and wave. It was exhilarating for her to go for skimming lightly over glistening, tilting waves, and to feel the steady, imperious surge of the water. Helen’s interests in rowing and swimming were not confined to ponds and lakes. She equally enjoyed the delights of sailing at sea. In 1901, she went to Nova Scotia. In the company of Miss Sullivan, she went to Halifax and they had the joy of spending their summer there. Walking along the harbour and setting sail to many places provided her with a peculiar kind of joy.</p>

Detailed Answer:<br />
Wright Humason School was specially meant for the education of Deaf. It was in New York City. It was well known for the training, given there in vocal culture and lip reading. Besides this, many subjects like Arithmetic, Physical Geography, French and German were taught there. The school possessed efficient staff for different subjects. One more thing—the staff was not only efficient but it was compassionate with children. The teachers tried their best to bring students nut of their painful circumstances. They always planned how they might give their pupils every advantage similar to those who hear and enjoy. They were always supportive and loving. They always tried to find such ways so as to make much of few tendencies and passive memories in the cases of little ones and lead them out of the strained circumstances in which their lives were set. Helen was sent to that school in 1994. Here, Helen acquired good knowledge of German. Miss Reamy taught her German. She was expert in making use of manual alphabet. She also made Helen comfortable in the conversation. With her efforts, she used to converse in that language with her teacher. The teacher also helped her to improve her speech in general.</p>
