Subject: Respecting the Dignity of women.<br />
Sir,<br />
I shall feel highly obliged if you publish the following views in the valuable columns of your esteemed paper.<br />
Women have always been the most vulnerable in any age, time, place and society. It has been observed over quite a long time that women are humiliated, tortured, harassed, stalked and molested. The other problems include sexual harassment, domestic violence and marital discord which cause a lot of embarrassment. Though strict measures are taken to improve the status of women in the society, the problem remains where it was.</p>
<p>As we all know, in modern India, women are playing a major role and have significant contribution in the welfare of democratic values. So, it is necessary to change the male mindset towards women. It is only possible by spreading awareness among women and the society at large Also, the bringing up of boys and girls should be done equally at home. This growing rate of violence against women can be stopped. Strict measures should be adopted by the society and the government in order to do so. Moreover, we should take a pledge to start campaigns against women violence and other such issues in order to increase the status and social standing of women, economically and politically.<br />
Your Sincerely<br />

<p>Question 6.<br />
Our performance in the Rio Olympics has told us that we do not pay enough attention to athletics and outdoor games. It is the time we revise our attitude. Sports should be an important part of every school&#8217;s daily routine. Write an article in 150-200 words on &#8216;Importance of Outdoor Games&#8217;. You are Sreej a/Thomas. [10]<br />

Sunitha, Secretary. Use the following clues: no. of volunteers—hours spent in teaching— location of the class—chairs, blackboards—no. of people attending the camp—benefit.<br />
Answer:<br />
IMPORTANCE OF OUTDOOR GAMES<br />
By Sreeja/Thomas<br />
As in the words of Muhammad Ali:<br />
&#8220;Champions are made from something they have deep inside them, — a desire, a dream, a vision&#8221;.<br />
But our performance in Rio Olympics tells a different story. A nation of more than 125 crores has not been able to produce a sportsperson, or an athlete of International standards even after 76 years of independence! What really is the reason behind the adverse condition of Indian sports? Growing craze of cellphones and video games among children are the official apathy and the lack of facilities are like an additional handicap. Also, at present, there is a lot of emphasis on academics which leads to the lack of time for the students to get indulge in sports activities. So, to brighten up the image of sports and games, indoor and outdoor games are equally important-one for relaxation and the other for physical exercise. Games such as Volleyball, Hockey, Cricket, Basketball, Football and Lawn Tennis provide recreation, develop sportsmanship and broaden the base of sports. There is no doubt that these outdoor games develop good habits, skills, knowledge and other social qualities required in a sportsperson. Sports personalities and players should be given proper training for them to be properly motivated. If we really want to revive our sports, the Govt, and sports authorities of India must put serious efforts into the matter. Proper facilities should be provided to the atheletes and new talent should be encouraged. In order to enhance the performance, we should chalk out weekly plans, meso-cycle plans, micro cycle and yearly plans for the sports person. Sports play an intergal part in education. So we should motivate all the students of an institution to take parts in games and sports. &#8216;A game for each and each for a game&#8217; may be considered the motto of sports.<br />

AN ADULT LITERACY CAMP<br />
By P. V. Sunitha, Secretary<br />
In order to enlighten the fruits of education, an adult literacy campaign Was conducted by Cultural Society, Sunshine Public School, Nellore from 2nd Feb., to 5th Feb. 20XX in our neighbourhood. The campaign was held with the motive of ensuring education for adults and helping them to become literate. During the campaign, 50 volunteers participated and spent 4 hours in teaching them. For this noble task, the community hall was selected at Janakpuri. Both males and females were enagaged and given a taste of education. They had arranged chairs, desks and blackboards for teaching them. More than 200 people attended the camp. They were provided with free copies, pencils and other necessary items. Every illiterate person was given special attention. It was hoped not only to achieve our target, but also to exceed the same. It was positively determined to make the campaign grand success. The chief-co-ordinator, Mr. Joshi, thanked all the volunteers, teachers and all the members who motivated the adults for gaining education, and for making the campaign a grand success.</p>

Answer:<br />
IN HONOUR OF MS GEETHA’S ACHIEVEMENT<br />
It is righty said that :<br />
&#8216;Surprises render more pleasure, especially when they are totally unexpected.&#8217;<br />
A very good morning to one and all. Respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends !<br />
I, Vinod, a student of class, XII feel extremely proud and honoured to speak about my loving teacher, Ms. Geeta P.G.T. (Eng.), who wrote the short story, &#8216;Sky is Not far&#8217;, which has won a national award. It is really a matter of pride for our school. Each one of us wants to touch the sky but only a few of us dare to chase our dreams and our English teacher fulfiled her dream with a strong determination and a keen hobby of writing stories. Her easy style of writing along with the issues linking to the everyday problems was well received by readers, particularly the youth. This short story deals with women&#8217;s struggles and essentially their attainment of the desired goals and the more women relate to it, it goes on and comes up with some other &#8216;newer issues&#8217;. This is really a great achievement for her and our school. Pier story is ultimate, unmatched and an excelled one. I feel extremely honoured for her service to the society and her excellent work. She will continue to be a source of inspiration to one and all.<br />
Thank you.<br />

PRIVATE CARS TOBE BANNED IN CONGESTED AREAS<br />
A very good morning to all of you here. Respected panel of jury members, teachers and my friends !</p>
<p>I, Raja, stand before you today to express my views regarding; Should private cars be banned in the congested commercial areas of cities&#8217; ?</p>
<p>I am in favour of the motion. It is causing a lot of inconvenience to the people who are forced to be stuck in congested areas. We must think unconventionally and alternatively to solve this problem. The roads leading to the commercial areas should be made one way roads during the peak traffic hours, i.e., between 8 am to 10 am and 5 pm to 8 pm respectively. Heavy fine should be levied on people who wait inside their vehicles in the &#8216;No waiting&#8217; area. More underground parking facilities need to be provided as there is a lack of parking lots. The officials should keep strict vigilance on this issue. It is noted, that a lot of cars generally hinders the efficiency of the commercial areas, because it creates traffic jams and they are the main cause of pollution. The Govt, should ban cars to force the people to use the public transportation provided and to reinforce the efficiency of commerce.</p>

Answer:<br />
The Maharaja had annoyed a senior British officer by refusing him the permission to hunt tigers in Pratibandapuram and even refusing to allow him to get photographed with a dead tiger.

The wizard used his magical spell to solve the problem after which, he went home and had a family dinner.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]<br />
Garbage to them is gold. How do ragpickers of Seemapuri survive ?<br />
OR<br />
The peddler thinks that the whole world is a rattrap. This view of life is true only of himself and of no one else in the story. Comment.<br />
Answer:<br />
Garbage provides the rag-pickers a means to survive. It is there daily bread. Sometimes, they find currency notes or even silver coins in the heaps of garbage. For them, it is wrapped in wonder and this grabage is nothing less than gold for them.</p>
<p>Poor Ragpicker like saheb spend their lives looking for gold in garbage dumps. The ragpickers of Seemapuri lived in structures of mud, tin and tarpaulin with no sewage or drainage system for running water. Their parents have no fixed income. They wage war against poverty and hunger. They have no dream except finding the means of survival. These people have lived there for more than thirty years without an identity or permit. They have got ration cards that enable them to buy grains and get names on the voter list. For them, food is more important for survival than an identity, rag picking is the means of their survival;<br />
OR<br />
This view of life is universal. It relates to everyone who was ever a victim of circumstances. The Peddler, a poor vagabond, makes and sells rattraps to make both ends meet. He even found a parable between the world and the rattrap. He had been living a despicable life of misery, poverty and frustation, visualising the whole world to be a rattrap ready to engorge anyone who succumbed to the bots of its riches and joy. The world had been rather unkind to only him as others like crofter, Edla and Ironmaster were not tempted with anything as they already had everything, so he felt happy to think ill about it. Despite the Crofter&#8217;s kindness and hospitality, he betrayed his trust and stole his money. But Edla&#8217;s compassion and understanding finally brought about a transformation in his nature. So, in his own opinion, only he suffars.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Answer the following question in 120-150 words: [6]<br />
Untouchability is not only a crime, it is inhuman too. Why and how did Bama decide to fight against it ?<br />
OR<br />
Good human values are far above any other value system. How did Dr. Sadao succeed as a doctor as well as a patriot ?<br />
Answer:<br />
When Bama acquainted her elder brother with that &#8216;funny episode&#8217; about an elderly man from low caste carrying a food packet by a string without touching it, those comic details could not make him laugh. He guided her properly. He explained to her the soical stigma of untouchability. He told her that they were the victim of social prejudice. Bama was highly inspired by the words of her elder brother.</p>
<p>She fought against untouchability by out classing the achievements of the higher class, thus, proving that she is no less than the higher classes. Filled with anger and revolt, she said, &#8216;We too are Human Beings; our people should never do these humiliating things for them. She fought against this oppression, prejudice, stigma, superstition and ignorance. She studied hard and earned a name for herself. She used writing as a tool in her struggle against the discrimination that constraints and binds the free flow of the spirit.<br />
OR<br />
The story, The Enemy, set during the World War, deals with a dilemma. When man faces difficult choices to be a patriotic or to be a professional, he acts impatiently in both the situations. Dr. Sadao is thoroughly professional and when it comes to his patients, he becomes oblivious to other facts. So, despite the fact that the injured man is an American Soldier, and an enemy, Dr. Sadao gives top priority to save the life of the dying soldier. As a doctor, he performed his first and foremost duty which is towards the sick and the injured who needs, his immediate attention, irrespective of his nationality. But later on, being a true patriotic nationalist and a loyal citizen of Japan, he handed him over to the police by informing the General about him. But the General is totally governed by self-absorption. This ultimately set Dr. Sadao to comply with the plan for him to escape. Thus, Dr. Sadao managed to serve as a doctor as well as a patriot.</p>

<p>Good morning everyone!<br />
Respected Principal, teachers and my dear friends. I, xyz the head girl of the school, am going to deliver a speech on Sakshi Malik. In India, where all the sisters were celebrating the day with their brothers on Raksha Bandhan, far away in Rio de Janeiro, a 23-year-old wrestler, Sakshi Malik, made the nation proud by winning a bronze medal.</p>
<p>Malik became the first female Indian wrestler who has bagged a medal in the Olympics.</p>
<p>Sakshi Malik, the daughter of a bus conductor, comes from a small district in Haryana. She started her training at the age of 12. Malik and her coach, Ishwar Dahiya, faced many problems during the initial stages of the former&#8217;s career as the mentality of the conservative society thought that wrestling was not meant for girls; it was thought to be a male sport. There are still so many people who are living with such male-dominant thinking.<br />
Not only has she proved to be one of the. best wrestlers in the world but also fought off long odds, bureaucratic obstacles, lack of facilities, and the conservative Indian society. Sakshi taught the nation that women in the country need support more than protection. We are proud to be the citizens of the nation where women like Sakshi Malik are born.<br />

<p>India has the second highest population in the world with 125 crore people and also is the biggest provider of skilled manpower in the world, currently India provides the maximum number of engineers to the world. It is also one of the largest markets for automobiles, high-value foods, etc. Large population means more intelligence that can be put to good effect and also skilled population draws more projects from foreign companies as well.</p>
<p>I, therefore, agree with the view that our large population is not a cause of poverty but an asset as every hand can become an earning hand for the economy and not a cause of poverty.</p>

(e) How did the Maharaja deal with a high ranking British officer who wanted to shoot a tiger ?<br />
(f) Having got rid of his stink, what problem did Roger Skunk face ?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Mr. H. Hamel did not scold Franz. He only said that it is not good to put off learning. He was overwhelmed with emotions as it was his last French lesson. So, he asked him to sit in his place quickly.<br />
(b) Sophie dreamt of becoming as boutique owner, and actress, a manager or a fashion designer. She wanted to be a part of the sophisticated world so that she could visit exotic places that the believed her brother want to.<br />
(c) While driving to the airport, in an effort to distract herself from the thoughts of her ageing mother, the poet looks at the young trees, &#8216;sprinting&#8217;. The trees seem to be running past the moving car. The sprinting of the trees symbolises the rapidly passing years of a human&#8217;s life from childhood to old age. This image, showing activity and strength, is contrasted with that of her old and weak mother who seems pale and dormant, sleeping in the car. The &#8216;young&#8217; trees represent life in contrast to her mother&#8217;s approaching death.<br />
(d) In the hot season, both men and beast relax in a bower and walk by a cooling covert made by the rills<br />
(e) The British Officer told the Maharaja that he wanted to hunt tigers in his kingdom but the Maharaja refused to give him his permission. The Maharaja himself wanted to kill a hundred tigers, so he had to refuse to give permission to the British Officer. Instead, he told the officer that if he wants to hunt boars, rats or even mosquitoes, there will be no problem. But hunting tigers could never be allowed.<br />
(f) He faced the problem from his mother who felt extremely annoyed. She could not stand that smell. She decided to take him right back to that &#8216;awful&#8217; wizard and ask him to give the original smell back to her boy.</p>

I am writing this letter in regard with the upgradation of the computer lab. The number of students in the computer class is increasing rapidly but the number of computers is not enough. Most of the computers are outdated which causes inconvenience to the students. The lab has to be renovated. More desktop computers and an adequate seating arrangement is needed. Therefore, I request for a grant of sufficient funds in order to purchase 25 more computer for the new session of the school. Kindly take a quick decision so that there no inconvenience is caused to the students.<br />
Thank you,<br />
Your&#8217;s sincerely,<br />

<p><strong>Section &#8211; C</strong></p>
<p>(LITERATURE : TEXT BOOKS AND LONG READING TEXT)</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]<br />
(a) What did Franz wonder about when he entered the class that day ?<br />
(b) What shocking experience did Douglas have at YMCA pool ?<br />
(c) Why does Kamala Das compare her mother to &#8216;a pale winter&#8217;s moon&#8217; ?<br />
(d) What rich boimty has the heaven given us? (A Thing of Beauty)<br />
(e) Why did the Maharaja have to pay a bill of three lakh rupes to the British jewellers ?<br />
(f) What problem did Roger Skunk face he went to play with his friends. How did he solve it ?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Franz had a bundle of surprises when he entered the class room. The village people were sitting quietly on the back benches. Mr. Hamel did not get angry with Franz, rather he requested him very kindly to go to his place and sit quietly. Mr. Hamel was dressed in his French lessons. He felt very sad.</p>
<p>(b) Douglas failed to come to the surface of the pool because when he reached the bottom, he felt his lungs were ready to burst. He tried to spring up, but came up slowly. He could see and feel nothing but water. He felt too suffocated. Fear gripped him and his legs seemed to have been paralyzed. Before he knew it, he was sinking back to the bottom.</p>
<p>(c) Since her childhood, Kamala Das had a fear that she would lose her mother in some way or the other or she would be separated from her. Now that her mother was sixty-six years old and had a deteriorating health, the poet&#8217;s fear returned with an even greater intensity.</p>
<p>(d) When everyting seems to be dead, the Earth still remains alive. Stillness cannot be confused with total inactivity. The seed that lie dormant through the winters, come to life in the spring season. So, there is a life under apparent stillness.</p>
<p>(e) Derry enters Mr. Lamb&#8217;s garden by climbing over the wall. When Mr. Lamb saw him entering his garden, he was startled, derry tried to explain that he didn&#8217;t intend to steal anything, but Mr. Lamb welcomed derry instead of getting angry and treated him as his friend. He also asked him to pick up the apples lying in the long grass.</p>
<p>(f) After killing seventy tigers, the Maharaja found that the tigers had become extinct in his kingdom and thirty tigers were still remained to be killed. So, he decided to marry a girl in the royal family of a state which has a large tiger population.</p>
