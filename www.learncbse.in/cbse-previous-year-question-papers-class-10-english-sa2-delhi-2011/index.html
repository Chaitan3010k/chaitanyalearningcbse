<strong>Question.1. Read the passage given below carefully. </strong><br />
<strong>School used to be all about writing, whether it was the exercise books we wrote in, the notes we passed round, or the lines we stayed in to do. But not any more. Now it&#8217;s all about typing. My six year old daughter is part of the first generation that is truly computer literate and I really didn&#8217;t want her learning copperplate writing. I could see that spelling, grammar, syntax and punctuation were important, but handwriting? By the time she&#8217;s at university, handwriting may not be as relevant as needlepoint. So when my daughter came home last year with cursive handwriting homework, I was nonplussed. Cursive was originally developed to make it easier for children to write with a quill. By joining up the letters, it kept the quill on the parchment and minimized ink blots. But my daughter writes with a laptop. I explained as much to her teacher at the next parents&#8217; day. But her teacher explained something to me. Research suggests that the process of writing information down on paper, by hand, has a more direct effect on the formation of memories in the learning process than typing. Taking notes in class is still the most effective way to learn. It&#8217;s&#8217; a better way to store the skills for written language in a child&#8217;s brain than pressing keys. There&#8217;s nothing old-fashioned about handwriting. Handwriting is w&#8217;here it&#8217;s at.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question.1.1 On the basis of your reading of the above passage fill in the blanks with appropriate</strong><br />
<strong>words/phrases:</strong><br />
<strong>(a) School used to be all about &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. and now it is all about &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</strong><br />
<strong>(b) According to the narrator his daughter is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</strong><br />
<strong>(c) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; was developed to make writing with a quill easier.</strong><br />
<strong>(d) The writer was puzzled when his daughter &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</strong><br />
<strong>(e) Writing information down on paper is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; typing in the learning process.</strong><br />
<strong>(f) The most effective way to learn is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. </strong><br />
<strong>(g) f Skills for written language can be stored better in a child&#8217;s brain by &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; rather than &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</strong><br />
<strong>(h) Writing by hand is &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>(a) writing; typing<br />
(b) computer literate<br />
(c) cursive writing<br />
(d) came home the year before with a cursive handwriting homework<br />
(e) a more direct effect on the formation of memories than<br />
(f) by taking down notes in class<br />
(g) writing; pressing keys<br />
(h) not old fashioned</p>
<p><strong>Question.2. Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
<strong>1. Summer vacation offers families dilemmas and opportunities. For too many kids it becomes a period of intellectual passivity and stalled personal growth. For others — and their parents — it&#8217;s a time of overload and frantic scheduling.</strong><br />
<strong>2. &#8220;Summer is a great time for parents to build a relationship with their children,&#8221; says a renowned child psychologist. And it&#8217;s an opportunity both for the kids to learn and for the family to grow together. To make this a reality, educators and psychologists point to several simple strategies that parents can start planning before summer gets under way.</strong><br />
<strong>3. &#8220;Summer&#8217;s a perfect time for kids to take skills they&#8217;ve learnt in a classroom and use them in new ways,&#8221; notes a well known educator. Comparing prices in a grocery shop can sharpen children&#8217;s mental maths skills. Taking measurements to build a new tree house or design a simple plaything teaches geometry. Car trips provide opportunities to study maps and learn geography. Some libraries offer free summer reading programmes for children.</strong><br />
<strong>4. Sometimes kids will need a small push in the right direction. Victoria encouraged her seven-year old son, Philip, to take part in their local library&#8217;s summer reading club. For every book report a child wrote, he received a raffle ticket. At the end of the summer sports prizes were raffled off. Philip, who&#8217;d painstakingly produced seven book reports won an autographed picture of a hockey star and had his name and one of his reports printed in the local newspaper. (If that&#8217;s not possible, encourage children to write letters to editors on current affairs, or about school-related issues.) &#8220;Philip moaned and groaned about writing the reports, but in the end, he was happy he put the effort in,&#8221; notes his mother. &#8220;And his ability to express himself really improved.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong>5. It&#8217;s the daily doses of stimulation — intellectual, creative, esteem-building—that parents can give their children that have the greatest impact,&#8221; says an eminent researcher. In an informal study conducted in 1998 other researches surveyed successful college students about how they spent their free time from ages five to 12, then compared their activities with those of troubled youngsters. They found that the successful ones were more likely to play spontaneous games, more involved in household chores and more likely to engage in playful activities with their parents. Troubled youngsters spent far less time on chores or family games and more time on their own, planted in front of the TV or a video game.</strong><br />
<strong>6. Often, when parents are drawing up their summer plans, their focus is on entertaining and enriching their children. But experts agree that a summer built completely around a child&#8217;s self-fulfillment won&#8217;t help a youngster mature into a high thinking, caring member of his family or community. Truly successful kids, say educators, are those who&#8217;ve learnt to budget time to help others—whether it&#8217;s helping an invalid neighbour or preparing their own family&#8217;s meals a couple of nights a week. Where parents fail, say experts, is in the way such responsibilities are presented. Too often, they&#8217;re trotted out as punishments instead of challenges. To make matters worse, parents often nag the child about the task, rather than simply setting a completion deadline and allowing the youngster to decide when and how he will meet it. </strong><br />
<strong>7. For most parents of school-age kids, the largest block of time they&#8217;ll have with their children is in the summer. With a little advance preparation, parents can use the summer to help develop their youngsters into smarter, more creative, more caring human beings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question.2.1. On the basis of your reading of the passage, answer the following questions briefly: </strong><br />
<strong>(a) How can parents give the kids a special summer vacation?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) In what new ways can kids use the skills they learn in the classroom during the</strong><br />
<strong>summer? Mention any two. </strong><br />
<strong>(c) What advantages did Philip have on writing the book reports?</strong><br />
<strong>(d) Why should a summer vacation not be built completely around a child&#8217;s fulfillment?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong> (a) Parents can give the kids a special summer by<br />
(i) building a relationship with their children<br />
(ii) stimulating them intellectually, creatively and by building their esteem.<br />
(b) During the summer vacations, kids can use skills they learn in the classroom in new ways. They can compare prices in grocery shops and sharpen their mental maths skills. They can take car trips to study maps and learn geography.<br />
(c) The advantages Philip had on writing the book reports were—<br />
(i) he won an autographed picture of a hockey star<br />
(ii) he had his name and one of his reports printed in the local newspaper.<br />
(d) A summer vacation should not be built around a child&#8217;s fulfillment because just focussing on entertainment does not help a youngster mature into a high thinking, caring member of his family or community. A successful kid is one who budgets time to help others.<br />

<strong>Answer.</strong>Save the Tiger<br />
There is no doubt that man has incessantly rebuked nature in each sphere and has shown little regards for even the hapless creatures of nature. He has never hesitated to harm natural beings to suit his own selfish purpose.<br />
Let us take for instance the case of the tigers whose falling numbers are proof enough for man&#8217;s wanton disregards of natural beings. Massive poaching in the past two years has wiped out an entire tiger population at one of the tiger reserves in India. The number of tigers in India in general has also been on a steady decline for the past twenty years. Their number has fallen from 4334 tigers in 2005 to 3500 tigers in the year 2012. This is indeed an unfortunate thing as the importance of tigers in maintaining the ecological balance in nature cannot be denied and ignored, and if tigers continue to be eliminated at the present alarming rate, it is sure to adversely affect the balance in nature. It is now high time we mended our wrong ways so as to save our national animal from total extinction.<br />
Our concern towards this problem is also its solution. AH efforts must be made to protect the tiger population of our country.<br />

Mushrooming of Private Institutes By. XYZ<br />
The mushrooming growth of unauthorized, illegal, and unrecognized private educational institutions in every nook and corner of the country, that adversely affect the fundamental rights of development and education, is a failure on the part of the government to regulate the opening and functioning of such institutes. The mushrooming of these private institutes in India has primarily occurred because of large-scale privatization of higher education and the simultaneous loss of government control over it. Devoid of proper infrastructure, qualified faculty, library etc., these institutes still charge exorbitant capitation fee for granting admission to prospective students. These private institutes can be termed as no better than &#8216;certificate-selling shops&#8217; whose motive is not to spread but sell education. The eruption of so many of these institutes in the country leaves much to<br />

<strong>Last night you heard a noise in your room. You opened your eyes and this is what you saw in the room. Write a story in 150-200 words about what happened then, </strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>On my birthday, I went to my grandmother&#8217;s house to seek her blessings. She asked me to do one good thing every day. The very next day on my way to school I found an opportunity to follow grandma&#8217;s advice and help an old man in need. As I was walking to school in the early hours of the morning, I saw an elderly man huddled in one comer. It was a cold January morning and the old man was clad in a thin cotton shirt and trousers. He appeared to be a poor and hungry soul and was shivering in the biting cold. I approached him gently and offered to take home with me where my parents could make the necessary arrangements to take care of him. He willingly accepted my offer and walked home with me. My mother gave him warm clothes and food to eat. My father arranged for him to get admitted in a shelter for the homeless where he could begin a new life. The old man could not thank me and my parents enough for our act of extreme kindness and gave us a million blessings.<br />

<strong>“Who is here so rude that wotdd not be a Roman ? If any, speak; for him I have offended. Who is here who is so vile that will not love his country? If any, speak; for him I have offended.&#8221; </strong><br />
<strong>(a) Who is the speaker of the above lines?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) Which incident is referred to in these lines?</strong><br />
<strong>(c) What is the reaction of the listeners?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>(a) At the Ouija board party, the ghost called John a traitor and then revealed her name as Helen on the board. This set the tongues of the people at the party wagging about John&#8217;s alleged relation with a lady called Helen. John had been so embarrassed and ridiculed by the ladies at the party that he fled the scene in disgust as he could not take their sly comments anymore. So he was not interested to know how the party ended.<br />
(b) Lavinia suspected John of infidelity and to show her anger and resentment to him she went to the guest room.<br />
(c) This phrase implies how for John time seemed to come to almost a standstill when even a few hours seemed like a few&#8217; centuries.<br />

<p><strong>Question.9. Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each. </strong><br />
<strong>(a) How did Patol Babu react to the news given to him by Nishikanto Ghosh?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) Why did the second game seem very real to Michael?</strong><br />
<strong>(c) Why did Calpumia beg Caesar not to go to the senate house?</strong><br />
<strong>(d) How did the Albatross save the mariners from the land of ice and snow?</strong><br />
<strong>(e) &#8216;And immediately I regretted it&#8217;. What did the poet regret and why?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong> (a) Patol Babu had not expected the news Nishikanto Ghosh had given him. He felt it was too good to be true, that an offer to act in a film had come to a 52-year old non-entity like him. It was beyond his wildest dreams. In his excitement he even mixed up his wife&#8217;s shopping list while buying provisions in the market.<br />
(b) In the second game &#8216;Dragonquest&#8217; the players were knights who had to save Princess Aurora from the dragon. It seemed very real to Michael because he received a message on the scoresheet from Sebastian to save him. All through the game as he and Sebastian were running away from the dragon, Michael could hear, feel and even smell the dragon in close pursuit.<br />
(c) Calpurnia begs Caesar not to go to the senate house because she had dreamt and heard about various unnatural occurrences on that day, which she felt were ill-omens. She considers them as a warning for Caesar&#8217;s forthcoming end. Fearing his life is in danger she forbids him from venturing out of the house.<br />
(d) After the albatross arrived on their ship the big icebergs surrounding the mariners&#8217; ship cracked and split enabling the helmsman to steer them out of the ice. Then a favourable southwind began to blow and the weather improved considerably. The mariners welcomed the albatross as a good Christian soul who had come to their rescue.<br />
(e) Patol Babu was highly satisfied that the acting part given to him had been done very well. Even though he needed the money very badly he felt the remuneration he would be given would be very insignificant when measured against the intense feeling of satisfaction that he had got for doing his small job with perfection and dedication. So he walked away before he could be paid for the job.</p>
<p><strong>Question.10. Patol Babu is a practical man who comes to terms with whatever life has to offer unlike most of the other people whose incessant greed and avarice never cease. Write a short article in about 80-100 words on the &#8220;Loss of moral values over material gains&#8221;.</strong><br />

<strong>“The encounter with the snake and the dual response of the poet to his presence at the water trough reflect a conflict between civilized social education and natural human instincts.&#8221; The poet writes a diary entry highlighting how he was torn between the two voices. Write his diary.</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong> Loss of Moral Values Over Material Sains<br />
Man&#8217;s incessant greed and lust for money has been the prime cause for his major follies. Never content with what he has, he forever strives to amass money and material goods by any means. Nowadays people are primarily interested in acquisition of money and status. The present day world is highly materialistic and the ever- increasing greed for money and matter at the cost of material values has engulfed the society as a whole. There are very few who can claim that materialism has not affected them in any way. We are not complacent with the fulfillment of our basic needs but we want to acquire more and more by hook or by crook even if we have to jeopardize moral and ethical values. The mania of this excess money has squeezed humanistic approaches and has made us misanthropes, stoic and egoistic in our efforts to fulfill this mad mania.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
11th July, 20xx<br />
As I was walking from my house to the water-trough in the dead summer heat I was confronted with a snake who had also come there to quench his Thirst. My instinctive feeling was that I had been honoured by the presence of this graceful creature who had chosen my water-trough to quench his thirst. But then I also heard the inner voice of my education that told me that I must kill this creature. To be a man I needed to kill this threat, but I did not feel the need to harm him. He was also a ’son of nature&#8217;, an equal, a &#8220;someone&#8221; who had simply arrived at the trough first. Though I will not deny my fear but it was secondary to the honour I instinctively felt. While I wrestled with these conflicting thoughts the snake continued his mission with an air of nobility. Finally, much to my disgust and dismay, out of fear or perhaps out of shame I took up the mantle of mankind and clumsily threw a log at him. The prince of the world quickly escaped uninjured while I was left only with regret at my mean act. I was my own master to choose between honouring the snake in the way that my soul was directing me to or walking in the shoes of contemporary man. Unfortunately, I gave in to my weakness in the end and put forth a half-hearted attempt to kill the snake which failed miserably, making me sin against myself and against nature.<br />

<strong>Give a brief character sketch of Otto Frank.</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong> Anne is amazed by the noble, unselfish work that a great number of organizations, such as &#8220;The Free Netherlands&#8221; are carrying out. They risk their own lives to help and save others. They forge identity cards, supply money to people &#8220;underground&#8221;, find hiding places for people and work for young men in hiding. They are ideal example of helper and have pulled up people like Anne&#8217;s family and Anne also hopes they will bring them safely to dry land. Never have the families in hiding heard even a single word of the burden which they certainly must be to the organization and never has anyone heard them complain of all the trouble these families give to them.<br />

He keeps Anne, Margot and Peter engaged in studying, reading and making family trees. He is generous, kind and level headed unlike the other adults in the Secret Annexe who are harsh and stingy. Anne continually tries to impress her father, live up to his expectations and obey his wishes. Otto Frank has a strong character and is clearly the head of the Frank household.<br />
<strong>Question.11B. How did Miss Reamy teach Helen German? 10</strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>Give a brief character sketch of Arthur H.Keller.</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>Miss Reamy was Helen&#8217;s German teacher in the Wright Humanson school for the Deaf in New York city. She went there in October, 1894, accompanied by Miss Sullivan. Miss Reamy used the manual alphabet to teach Helen, and after Helen had acquired a small vocabulary&#8217;, they talked together in German, and within a few months Helen could understand almost anything Miss Reamy said. Before the end of the first year Helen had read &#8216;Wilhelm Tell&#8217; with the greatest delight. Helen thought she made more progress in the German language than in any of her other studies.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Helen&#8217;s father, Arthur H.Keller was a captain in the Confederate Army. According to Helen her tather was most loving and indulgent, devoted to his home and seldom left them except during the hunting season. She had been told that he was a celebrated shot. Next to his family he loved his dogs and gun. His hospitality was great, almost faultless and he seldom Came home without bringing a guest along with him. He took special pride in his big garden, where he raised the finest watermelons and strawberries in the country. Helen remembers his caressing touch as he would lead her from one tree to another eagerly delighted by whatever pleased her. He was also a famous storyteller and after Helen had acquired language he would spell clumsily into her hand his cleverest anecdotes.</p>

<strong>(a) With what plea did the conspirators approach Caesar in the senate house?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) Patol Babu doubted that the people at the film unit would be able to appreciate his work. Why?</strong><br />
<strong>(c) The narrator says, &#8220;Sebastian Shultz was the game&#8221;. What does he mean when he says this?</strong><br />
<strong>(d) Why did the snake flicker its tongue?</strong><br />
<strong>(e) What message is conveyed through the poem &#8216;Ozymandias&#8217;?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>(a) The conspirators approached Caesar with the plea that he revoke the banishment of Publius Cimber. Publius&#8217;s brother, Metellus Cimber and the other conspirators wanted Caesar to grant pardon to Publius Cimber immediately and recall the order of his banishment.<br />
(b) Patol Babu was aware of the fact that people at the film unit caught hold of non-entities like him, got them to do a job, paid them for their labour and then forgot all about them. So he knew&#8217; they would not even understand, forget appreciate how much labour and imagination had gone into his miniscule performance.<br />
(c) By saying this the narrator means that each time he played a psycho-drive game, he ended up trying to save Shultz. At the end of each game the narrator received a message from Shultz appealing to save him. He finally realized that his mission in the games was to save Sebastian Shultz and thus &#8220;Sebastian Shultz was the game.&#8221;<br />
(d) The snake flickered its tongue w&#8217;hich is a typical snake-attribute. Snakes flicker their tongues often to sense smells in the air in search of prey. Here too the snake flickers his tongue after completely satisfying his thirst.<br />
(e) Only the legs of the statue stand erect, the upper portion has fallen and is almost buried in the desert. Everything except Ozymandias&#8217;s cruel face was destroyed with the passage of time. So the message conveyed through this poem is that the glories of our blood and state are mere shadow&#8217;s and not everlasting. Even the authority of a king has to end. Their attempt to immortalise themselves by building statues and monuments is futile as they too get ruined as time passes by.</p>

She wanted to (e) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. music like that. Soon Catherine was studying violin. Her talent was exceptional. (f) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;the time she was five she had played a public solo.</strong><br />

<p><strong>Question.9. Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 ivords each. 8</strong><br />
<strong>(a) What impression do you form of Ozymandias after reading the poem?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) How were the mariners trapped in the South Pole?</strong><br />
<strong>(c) Why did Helen and her fellow ghosts set-up the Writer&#8217;s Inspiration Bureau?</strong><br />
<strong>(d) How had Sebastian Shultz entered the games?</strong><br />
<strong>(e) Why does Patol Babu walk away before he can be paid for his role?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>(a) Ozymandias is rather proud of his position, power and glory. He appears to be a vain and conceited king who revels in the magnitude of his own achievements to such an extent that he feels the achievements of his fellow kings pale into insignificance when<br />
(b) After a brief spell of sailing smoothly, &#8216;a tyrannous&#8217; storm drove the ship Southward to the region of snow and mist. The storm was so powerful and fierce that it completely overtook the ship, which was caught in its fury. The ship was forcibly driven to the South Pole by the storm.<br />
(c) The Writer&#8217;s Inspiration Bureau was set-up by Helen and her fellow ghosts to help authors without ideas to write. The members of the Bureau would scout around till they found a writer without ideas and with a mind soft enough to accept impression. Then their main office would assign the case to one of the ghosts.<br />
(d) At the time of his accident, Sebastian was using his laptop to play a psycho-drive game. Since Sebastian had been plugged into the computer, when he had banged his head in the accident, the computer had saved his memory into its own. So in this way Sebastian had entered the psycho-drive games.<br />
(e) Patol Babu walks away before he could be paid for his acting job because the payment that would be made to him seemed paltry when measured against the intense satisfaction that he had got on doing his job with dedication and perfection.</p>
