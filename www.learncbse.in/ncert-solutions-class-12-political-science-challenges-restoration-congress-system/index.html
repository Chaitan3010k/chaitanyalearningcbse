<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> (d) Consult the senior and experienced leaders of the party</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â (a) Advantage: If the party follows the footsteps of the party president, there will be discipline and unity within the party.<br />
Shortcoming: The party president can take its decision without taking into consideration the views of its party members. So, the inner democracy may get weakened.<br />
(b) Advantage: If the party listens to the majority group, there will be more confidence among the party members and inner democracy will be strengthened.<br />
Shortcoming: If the party listens to the majority group, factionalism may increase in the party. One faction may try to back another faction to gather support.<br />
(c) Advantage: Secret ballot voting is an appropriate system. It is more democratic. Through it, any member can express his views.<br />
Shortcoming: Sometimes, the party members may vote through secret ballot by ignoring the whip of the party issued by the party president. It may prove fatal to the party.<br />
(d) Advantage: The novice and less experienced candidates will be benefited if they consult the senior and experienced leaders of the party and also follow their guidelines. Shortcoming: If the party members only consult the senior and experienced leaders and follow their guidelines, their hold will get strengthened in the party.</p>

<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Defection refers to an elected representative leaves the party on whose symbol he/she is elected and joins another party. This culture developed in Indian Politics after 1967 elections.<br />
Its two demerits were as follows:<br />
1. It played an important role in making and unmaking of government frequently.<br />
2. The constant realignments and shifting political loyalties in this period gave rise to the expression âAaya Ram, Gaya Ramâ.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>3. Why was the year 1967 considered a landmark year in Indiaâs political and electoral history? Explain.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The fourth general election was held in 1967 for the first time without Nehru:<br />

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4. These election results were called as a âPolitical Earthquakeâ.4. How can we see re-emergence of Indira Gandhi to power in 1971?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Congress (R) under Indira Gandhi had an issue, an agenda and a positive slogan which was lacked by its opponents. The âGrand Allianceâ had only one common i programme âIndira Hataoâ:<br />
1. In contrast to this, Indira Gandhi put forward a positive slogan âGaribi Hataoâ.<br />
2. By this, she generated a support base among poor, minorities, landless labourers, dalit, women and unemployed youth.<br />
3. Except it, she focused on the growth of public sector, imposition of ceiling on rural land holdings and urban property, removal of disparity etc.<br />
4. Thus, the slogan of Garibi Hatao and programmes became the part of Indira Gandhiâs political strategy of building an independent nationwide political support base during the electoral contest of 1971.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>5. What is meant by âPrivy Pursesâ? Why did Indira Gandhi insist on abolishing them in 1970?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>âPrivy Pursesâ was the form of grant in heredity given to the rulers and their families:<br />
1. The grant or âPrivy Purseâ was measured on the basis of extent revenue and potential of the merging state in the assurance given at the time of integration of princely states.<br />
2. Privy purses were criticised, the privileges given to princely states at the time of accession, integration and consolidation were protested.<br />
3. Hence, some leaders like Indira Gandhi insisted on abolishing the privy purses because hereditary privileges were not constant with the principle of equality, social and economic justice laid down in the constitution.<br />
4. Hence in the elections of 1971, Indira Gandhi made this a major election issue and got a lot of public support<br />
and alongwith massive victory in 1971 election, the constitution was amended to remove legal obstacles for abolition of privy purses.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>6. How did the outcome of 1971 elections help in restoration of Congress?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Congress (R) under Indira Gandhi had an issue an agenda and a positive slogan which was lacked by its opponents. The âGrand Allianceâ had only one common programme âIndira Hataoâ:<br />

2. By this, she generated a support base among poors, minorities, landlors labourers, dalits, women and unemployed bye youth.<br />
3. Except it, she focused on the growth of public sector, imposition of ceiling on rural land holdings and urban property, removal of disparity etc.<br />

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>l. Analyse any three major factors which led the popularity of Indira Gandhiâs Government in the early 1970s.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â (i) The fifth general elections to Lok Sabha were held in February 1971. The electoral contest appeared to be loaded against Congress (R). After all, the new Congress was just one faction of an already weak party. Everyone believed that the real organizational strength of the Congress Party was under the command of Congress (O). To make i matters worse for Indira Gandhi, all the major non-Communist, non Congress opposition parties formed an electoral alliance known as the Grand Alliance. Yet the new Congress had something that its big opponents lacked â it had an issue, an agenda and a positive slogan. The Grand Alliance did not have a coherent political programme. Indira Gandhi said that the opposition alliance had only one common programme Indira Hatao (Remove Indira). In contrast to this, she put forward a positive programme captured in the famous slogan: Garibi Hatao (Remove poverty).<br />
(ii) Indira Gandhi focussed on the growth of the public sector, imposition of ceiling on rural land holdings and urban poverty, removal of disparities in income and opportunity, and abolition of princely privileges. Thus, the slogan Garibi Hatao and the programmes that followed it were part of Indira Gandhiâs political strategy of building an Independent nationwide political support base. As a result, she won 352 seats with about 44 per cent of the popular votes on its own in the Lok Sabha elections of 1971.<br />
(iii) Soon after the 1971 Lok Sabha election, a major political and military crises broke out in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). The 1971 elections were followed by the crisis in East Pakistan and the Indo- Pak war leading to the establishment of Bangladesh. These events added to the popularity of Indira Gandhi. Even the opposition leaders admired her statesmanship.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>2. Examine the three main reasons responsible for the split in Congress during 1969.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Or</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Describe the various aspects of presidential election of 1969.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The formal split in Congress took place in 1969 on the issue of nomination of the candidate during presidential elections:<br />
1. Despite, Indira Gandhiâs representatives, the syndicate nominated Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, as the official Congress candidate for ensuring presidential elections.<br />
2. Indira Gandhi retaliated the situation by encouraging Mr. V.V. Giri, the then Vice President, to be nominated as an independent candidate.<br />
3. During election, the then Congress president S. Nijalingappa issue a âWhipâ asking all Congress MPs, MLAs to vote for N. Sanjeeva Reddy.<br />
4. On the other hand, after silently supporting V.V. Giri, the Prime Minister Indira Gandhi openly called for a conscience vote to vote the way they want.<br />
5. Elections went in favour of V.V. Giri due to this diplomatic effort and N. Sanjeeva Reddy was defeated.<br />
6. The defeat of N. Sanjeeva Reddy, the formal Congress candidate, formalised the split of party into two:<br />
(a) Congress (0) i.e organisation led by Syndicate, known as Old Congress.<br />
(b) Congress (R) i.e. requisitionists led by Indira Gandhi, known as New Congress.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>3. Which six factors contributed to the popularity of Indira Gandhiâs government in the decade of 1970s?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Because:<br />
1. Socialist credentials became main projects during this period.<br />
2. Indira Gandhi campaigned to implement land reform legislation and land ceiling legislations.<br />
3. She ended her dependence on other political parties by strengthening her partyâs position and recommended the dissolution of Lok Sabha in December 1970.<br />
4. The crisis in East Pakistan and Indo- Pak war to establish Bangladesh as an independent one, also enhanced the popularity of Indira Gandhi.<br />
5. Indira Gandhi and her government was not accepted only as a protector of the poor and under privileged but as a strong government also.<br />
6. Congress became popular among different social sections and restored dominance again.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4. Examine the grave economic crisis prior to fourth general election of 1967. Assess the electoral verdict also.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Indira Gandhi government devalued Indian rupee to check economic crisis of 1967. Consequently, one US dollar could be purchased for less than ? 5 after devaluation, it cost more than ? 7.<br />
1. The economic situation triggered a price rise.<br />
2. People started protest against increase in prices of essential commodities and unemployment etc.<br />
3. The Communist and Socialist parties launched struggle to avail greater equality.<br />
The fourth general election was held in 1967 for the first time without Nehru:<br />
1. The election verdict was not in favour of Congress and results jolted the Congress both at the national and state levels.<br />
2. Half the ministers in Indira Gandhiâs cabinet were defeated including K. Kamraj in Tamilnadu, S.K. Patil in Maharashtra, Atulya Ghosh in West Bengal, K.B. Sahay in Bihar.<br />
3. Congress did not lose only majority in seven states but two other states also prevented it to form government due to defections.<br />
4. For the first time any non-Congress party secured majority in any state and in other eight states different non-Congress parties formed the coalitions.<br />
5. These election results were called as a âPolitical Earthquakeâ.</p>
