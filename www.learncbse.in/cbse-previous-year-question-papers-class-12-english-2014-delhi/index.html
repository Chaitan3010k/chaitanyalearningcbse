Xyz, 13th June, 20XX, The torrential rain in the past few days flooded our area causing irrecoverable damage to the properties.

<p>Question 6.<br />
You are Rajendra Kumar, a social worker, You read an article in The Hindu on &#8216;Health care for Indian Workers&#8217;. Write a speech in 125¬150 words on the importance of health care to be delivered at a public function to create awareness among the workers. [10]<br />
OR<br />
Media has a strong hold on society. Write a speech in 125-150 words on how media influences public opinon to be delivered in the school assembly.<br />
Answer:<br />
HEALTH CARE FOR INDIAN WORKERS<br />
Good morning to all. Today I, Rajendra Kumar, am going to deliver a speech on the topic &#8216;Health care for Indian workers&#8217; Recently, I had read an article in the local newspaper The Hindu and wondered why we don&#8217;t care for the health of the workers around us. We remain mute spectators to their misery trials and tribulations of life.</p>
<p>Often, the workers are found working in inhuman conditions, neglecting their health. They are exploited, as they are illiterate and lacking awareness of a hygienic way of life. The authorities must ensure clean and healthy working conditions for these people. It is the responsibility of the government to provide affordable healthcare services to workers and their families. Indian workers should be taught the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. Many non-governmental organizations can play a role in spreading awareness about health and hygiene.</p>
<p>Workers play a major role in our life. We must understand and appreciate their contribution towards society. Access to basic health facilities is their innate right. As responsible citizens, we should get together to make their lives healthy. However, we should not forget that it is the sweat and blood of these workers which has provided us with enormous comfort while we sit in our well-furnished homes.<br />
Thank you<br />
OR<br />
IMPACT OF MEDIA<br />
Good morning everybody. Today, I Xyz am here to voice my concerns on how Media influences public opinion?<br />
Media acts as a powerful weapon in democracy. It keeps people abreast with the recent changes and development in the society and the world. They also help people to understand the various developments and build their opinion about the same. With the development of better modes of communications, the influence of media has increased. Consequently, its responsibility of delivering correct information has also increased. If people blindly believe the biased news which the print and electronic media tell us, our democracy will suffer badly. Media has the power to showcase both the facets of a piece of information. It should work towards helping the common man and understand the pros and cons of any issue or event.</p>
<p>Thus, one can clearly say that it is the responsibility of media and the media personnel to ensure that they direct their efforts towards building a constructive and balanced society as well as a nation.<br />
Thank you</p>

(b) The beauty, vastness and radiance of things tempt them.<br />
(c) According to the poet, those children spent their whole lives like rodents confined in &#8216;their cramped holes&#8217;. The undernourished bodies of those children looked almost like skeletons. Their steel-framed spectacles with repaired glasses made them look like, the broken pieces of a bottle scattered on stones. Since, their entire lives revolved around slums, their future also seemed blotted.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Answer any two of the following questions in about 30-40 words : [2 × 2 = 4]<br />
(a) How does Kamala Das try to put away the thoughts of her ageing mother?<br />

(c) What are the difficulties that Aunt Jennifer faced in her life?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Kamala Das is troubled by the thoughts of her ageing mother and tries to console herself by looking outside at the car. The sight is full of youthful whim and vigour. She watches the trees &#8216;sprinting&#8217; past her speeding car and the children, full of life and activity, running out of their houses to play. Her ashen like mother irks her so much that for a moment she ponders over the past memories to feel solace.</p>
<p>(b) The exotic moment the author talks about is when everyone keeps quiet and still. The moment would be extraordinarily tranquil, with no hustle-bustle of the frenzied world.

(g) Which words of her brother made a deep impression on Bama?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Gandhiji believed that the. peasants were under the grip of fear. He felt that taking the Champaran&#8217;s case to the court would be useless because actual relief for the peasants would come when they would be free from fear. So, his ultimate motive was to kill the fear in them.</p>

Answer:<br />
YOUTH, THEIR PROBLEMS, AND SOLUTIONS<br />
Good Morning! I am Sampreet an educationist and today I am going to deliver a speech on the topic youth their problems and solution Aspirations are now high and with this the level of competition and peer pressure among the youth has been increasing with each passing day. The youth is either not yet matured or trained enough to handle so much stress and, therefore, they ultimately get frustrated, easily commit suicide get involve in, road-rage, hatred crimes, drug abuse, looting, rapes etc. At the slightest provocation, they hold out protests and demonstrations. The minimum desired level of tolerance is missing in them. They don&#8217;t see any harm in violating the norms and fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The solution is a doddle one. The youth of today needs our untinted support, it needs to know that, irrespective of the situations they are in they are always loved by their parents, teachers and elders. They need to develop confidence in their capabilities. We need to remove the unnecessary pressure that our education system exerts on the young minds. It needs to be eased and, CCE is a positive step in this direction. Counsellors can help the young generation to understand and solve their problems. More job opportunities need to be created, better recruitment processes are need to be developed, and professional courses that equip them with necessary skills have to be designed.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to impart value-based education so that they achiveve high self-esteem, tolerance and patience and more importantly the zeal to create a clean and civilised society and to be a good citizen.<br />
OR<br />
CORRUPTION, ITS CAUSES AND SOLUTIONS<br />
Good morning, friends! I am Venkat. As a journalist and a responsible citizen of India, it is my duty to shed light and apprise you, that how corruption exists in almost every nook and comer of our country.</p>
<p>Corruption can be understood as misappropriation of government, public property or money. It is an unlawful and immoral act. Corruption has had a gradual growth in our country. How and why did corruption become so common in our country? India&#8217;s colonial past has contributed in flourishing corrupt practices. It is said that corruption cannot survive long in this world. Although, with the increase in scientific technology and advancement of the nation, corruption still remains unbeatable. The corruption also has a relation with scarcity and exists especially because of the vested interests and greed of the people in power.</p>
<p>It is the spasmodic snare of corruption which springs from all prodigality and dissipation. Whatever the reason may be, corruption is an ill practice that is seen as the major hindrance in the process of economic growth and modernization of the nation. The need for an anti-corruption bill like Jan Lokpal has long been discerned now. But, in a democracy like India, the power of the common man should not be underestimated. Constant vigil and intervention by the civil society is also required to bring positive changes in the country. Punishment must be increased and illegally confiscated wealth must be recovered. As aware citizens and of course as in united whole, we must overcome our flaws and work towards bringing about a corruption free society.</p>

<p>Subject: Unauthorized Parking of Vehicles<br />
Dear Sir,<br />
This is to draw your attention towards the problems faced due to unauthorized parking of the vehicles in our area. There is not a single day in our area when the place is without disorder or free from traffic jams. As it is a crowded place, there is inadequate parking space. It creates problems not only to the residents but also to the people who come to meet their relatives or for some other purpose. As it is a busy area, vehicles are parked all over in a haphazard manner. It often results in quarrel among the people who display the lack of civic sense in them also creating noise pollution. It is therefore necessary to take some quick actions and provide the proper parking area to the residents as well as do some arrangements for the visitors too.<br />
We all hope for an immediate action to get relief from this problem.</p>

Yours Sincerely,<br />

OR<br />
What benefits did Derry reap from his association with Mr. Lamb?<br />
Answer:<br />
Sophie was a daydreamer although she belonged to a middle-class family. She was blind to the bitter truth of life. She dreamt of an imaginary life, in which she owned a boutique full of beautiful things. She also dream of becoming an actress as there was a lot of money and fame in the profession. She also wanted to be a fashion designer. It can be said that she wanted to lead a lavish and grand life which was not possible. Her dreams were unrealistic in the sense that ultimately she would have to work in a biscuit factory. She only thought of impractical things. The house in which she lived was also not a very good one and her father used to work hard to earn bread for the family. They entertained themselves by watching the United team&#8217;s matches. That&#8217;s how she wanted to achieve the impossible dream.<br />
OR<br />
Derry had no association with the outer world till he met Mr. Lamb. His meeting with Mr. Lamb was a turning point in his life.

Mr. Lamb inspired him to face the world in spite of his disability. Derry&#8217;s thinking towards people and life completely changed and he became self-confident. Mr. Lamb successfully infused in him courage and self-determination. He advised him to ignore the comments made by people on his physical impairment and enjoy beauty of life and nature. Derry went back to Mr. Lamb&#8217;s garden in spite of his mother&#8217;s refusal., Derry understood the importance and true meaning of life and understanding himself better than before. Only due to the association with Mr. Lamb.</p>
