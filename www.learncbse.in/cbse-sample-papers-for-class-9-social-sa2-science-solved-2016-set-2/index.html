<p><strong>9. How did the Forest Acts affect the lives of foresters and villagers ? Explain.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Explain the impact of Forest Acts on the nomads or pastoralists.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Explain briefly the factors which led to the enclosures in England.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>.(i) Various restrictions : The Forest Act meant severe hardship for villagers across the country. After the Act, all their forest activities like cutting wood for their houses, grazing their cattle, collecting fruits and roots, hunting and fishing became illegal.<br />
(ii)Impact on cultivators : Shifting cultivation was the most common cultivation practised by the people. But this was banned because European foresters regarded this harmful for the forests.<br />
(iii) Displacement of the people : To protect the forests, the Europeans started displacing villagers without any notice or compensation.<br />
Or<br />
(i)Through these Acts, some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed an access to these forests.<br />
(ii)These Forest Acts changed the lives of the pastoralists. They were now prevented from entering many forests that had earlier provided valuable forage for their cattle.<br />
(iii)Even in the areas, they were allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed a permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was specified, and the number of days, they could spend in the forest, was limited.<br />
Or<br />
(i)Rising Demand for wool: In the 16th century, the demand for wool went up in the world market. This had a direct impact on the price of wool and profits. Rich farmers wanted to expand wool production to earn more profits. For this, they were eager to improve their sheep breeds. They started enclosing open fields to provide proper pastures to the sheep.<br />
(ii)Various Acts : The early enclosures were usually created by individual landlords. They were not supported by the state or the church. But after 1850, many Acts were passed to legalise the enclosures.<br />
(iii) Rapid rise in Population : There was a rapid growth of population of England between the 18th and the 19th centuries. Between 1750 and 1900, it multiplied over four times. The increased population means more demand for foodgrains and other products. Due to increase in population the pressure on land also increased and the people had no other option except to enclose open fields.</p>

(ii)He suggested the government to formulate rules to use the forests, and to train the people.<br />
(iii)He set up the Indian Forest Service in 1864 and helped to formulate the Indian Forest Act of 1865.<br />
Or<br />
(i)The colonial state wanted to transform all grazing lands into cultivated farms as Land revenue was one of the main sources of its finance. By expanding cultivation, it could increase its revenue collection.<br />
(ii)It could at the same time produce more jute, cotton, wheat and other agricultural produce that were required in England.<br />
(iii)To colonial officials, all uncultivated land appeared to be unproductive : it produced neither revenue nor agricultural produce. It was seen as ‘waste land’ that needed to be brought under cultivation.<br />
In most areas, the lands taken over were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists. So the expansion of cultivation inevitably meant the decline of pastures and a problem for pastoralists.<br />
Or<br />
(i)The expansion of wheat agriculture and overgrazing of the Prairies were responsible for the Dust Bowl tragedy.<br />
(ii)In 1930s, terrifying duststorms began to blow over the southern plains.<br />
(iii)These duststorms had a great impact on the economic and social life of the people.</p>

(ii)Death Rate : It is the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year. Rapid decline in death rates is the main cause of growing population rapidly. Since 1981 birth rates have also started declining gradually resulting in a gradual decline in the rate of population growth.<br />
(iii)Migration : It is the movement of people across regions and territories. Migration can be internal or international. Internal migration does not change the size of the population within the nation. Migration plays a very significant role in changing the composition and distribution of population.</p>

<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>Why are Maasai of Africa continuously losing their grazing grounds? Explain any five reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>How did the enclosure movement benefit Britain? Explain any five benefits.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Various restrictions : The Forest Act meant severe hardship for villagers across the country. After the Act, all their forest activities like cutting wood for their houses, grazing their cattle, collecting fruits and roots, hunting and fishing became illegal.<br />
(ii)Impact on cultivators: Shifting cultivation was the most common cultivation practised by the people. But this was banned because European foresters regarded this harmful for the forests.<br />
(iii) Displacement of the people: To protect the forests, the Europeans started displacing villagers without any notice or compensation.<br />
(iv)Various taxes : The Europeans started imposing heavy taxes on the forest people.<br />
(v)Loss of livelihood: The Europeans started giving large European trading firms, the sole right to trade in the forest. Grazing and hunting by local people were restricted. In the process, many pastoralists and nomadic communities lost their livelihood.<br />
Or<br />
<strong>The main reasons for the continuous loss of grazing lands are :</strong><br />
(i)European imperial powers scrambled for territorial possessions in Africa, slicing up the region into different colonies.<br />
(ii)Maasai land was divided into British Kenya and German Tanganyika.<br />
(iii)Subsequently, the best grazing lands were gradually taken over for the white settlements and Maasai were pushed into a small area.<br />
(iv)The Maasai lost about 60 per cent of their pre-colonial lands.<br />
(v)They were confined to an arid zone with uncertain rainfall and poor pastures.<br />
(vi)Large areas of grazing land were also turned into game reserves.<br />
<strong>(Any five points to be explained)</strong><br />
Or<br />
(i)Grain production grew as quickly as population.<br />
(ii)Landlords sliced up pasturelands, carved up open fields, cut up forest commons, took over marshes, and turned larger areas into agricultural fields.<br />
(iii)Enclosures were seen as necessity to make long term investments on land.<br />
(iv)Planned crops rotation to improve their soil.<br />
(v) It also allowed the rich landowners to expand the land under their control and produce more for the markets.</p>
<p><strong>22. ‘Cricket in India was organised on the principle of race and religion.’ Justify. </strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>Explain how clothes were used by Gandhiji as a powerful weapon to protest against the British rule.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) When there was a quarrel between the Bombay Gymkhana and the Parsi cricketers over the use of public park, the Britishers favoured the Bombay Gymkhana.<br />

(iii)They encouraged Pentangular tournament as it was based on communities.<br />
(iv) The first class cricket was also organised on communal and racial lines. The teams that played colonial India&#8217;s greatest and most famous first-class cricket tournament did not represent regions, but religious communities.<br />
(v)The applications that seek permission to built a cricket club based on a community were given priority by the Britishers.<br />
Or<br />

<p><strong>23.Explain the factors which influence the climate of India.    </strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>(i) The Himalayan mountain chain: It protects the Indian subcontinent from cold winds of the Central Asia. It creates barrier before the South-west monsoon.<br />
(ii) Western disturbances : Western disturbances originate near the Mediterranean Sea. These cause rainfall in the north-west.<br />
(iii)Low pressure region of Central Asia and Tibet: During summer, low pressure region is formed over the Middle-East countries, Central Asia and Tibet. This induces a burst of monsoon in our country.<br />
(iv)Jet streams : The air currents blowing in the upper layer of the atmosphere are known as jet streams. These help the Western Disturbances to enter into India.<br />
(v)Latitude : The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of the country from the Rann of Kuchchh in the west to Mizoram in the east. Almost half of the country, lying south of the Tropic of Cancer, belongs to the tropical area. All the remaining area, north of the Tropic, lies in the subtropics. Therefore, India’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as subtropical climates.</p>
<p><strong>24.Why are evergreen or tropical rain forests found in western slopes of the Western Ghats ? Mention any four features of these forests.  </strong><br />

(iv)Some of the commercially useful trees of these forests are ebony, mahogany and rosewood.</p>
<p><strong>25. How has the Indian Constitution ensured the independence of the judiciary ? Explain.    </strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> The ‘Independence of the Judiciary’ means that the judiciary should not be under the influence or control of any individual or authority. If the Legislature or Executive is in a position to influence the judiciary in any way, the judges will not be able to give impartial justice.<br />
(i)Appointment of Judges : The Judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts are appointed by the President of India in consultation with other judges.<br />
(ii) Security of Tenure : A Judge can remain in office till he has attained the age of 65 years (in case of Supreme Court) and 62 years (in case of High Court). He can be removed by the President on the ground of “proved misbehaviour or incapacity.” But the resolution for his impeachment should be passed by both the Houses.<br />
(iii) Salaries, etc. are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India : The salaries are charged on the Consolidated Fund of India and cannot, therefore, be voted upon by the Parliament.<br />
(iv)Non Discussion with respect to the conduct of any Judge : No discussion shall take place in Parliament with respect to the conduct of any judge in the discharge of his duties when a motion for his removal is under consideration.</p>
<p><strong>26. What is an election ? Discuss the importance of elections in a democracy. </strong><br />
