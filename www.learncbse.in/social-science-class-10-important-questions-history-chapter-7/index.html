Many vernacular newspapers like the &#8216;Indian Mirror&#8217;, &#8216;Bombay Samachar&#8217;, &#8216;The Amrita Bazar Patrika&#8217;, &#8216;The Hindu/ &#8216;The Kesari&#8217; and several others had a great influence on the political life of the country. A continuous flow of articles by national leaders and thinkers like Gandhiji, Tagore, Tilak, etc. passed on ideas of a new free India to the masses and prepared them for the national struggle.</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />
How did the printers manage to attract the people, largely illiterate, towards printed books? (2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
The rate of literacy was very low in European countries till the twentieth century:</p>
<ul>
<li>To attract the illiterate common people towards printed books, publishers realised the wider reach of printed work whereby even those who could not read could certainly enjoy listening to books being read out.</li>
<li>So printers began publishing popular ballads and folk tales. Such books would be profusely illustrated with pictures.</li>
<li>These were also sung and recited at gatherings in villages and in taverns in towns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 19.<br />
What were the new inventions that increased the circulation of printed materials? (2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
With the growing demand for books, woodblock printing gradually became more and more popular and was widely used in Europe to print textiles, playing cards, and religious pictures with simple, brief texts. The breakthrough in printing technology occurred when Johann Gutenberg developed the first printing press.</p>
<p>The Olive Press provided the model for the printing press, and moulds were used for casting the metal types for the letters and alphabet. The first book Gutenberg printed was Bible. As the number of printing press grew, book production boomed. The shift from hand printing to mechanical printing led to the print revolution.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
Give any three reasons favouring shift from hand printing to mechanical printing in China? (2013)<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>By the 17<sup>th</sup> century, urban culture bloomed in China and the use of print diversified. It was important for a shift from hand printing to mechanical printing in China to take place. Print was no longer used just by scholar-officials. Merchants used print in their everyday life to collect trade information.</li>
<li>Reading increasingly became a leisure activity. Rich women began to read and many women began publishing their poetry and plays.</li>
<li>In the late 19th century as Western powers established their outposts in China, western printing techniques and mechanical presses were imported. Shanghai became the hub of the new print culture catering to Western-style schools.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 21.<br />
Highlight any three circumstances that led to the intermingling of the hearing culture and the reading culture. (2014)<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the printing press, a new reading public emerged. Printing reduced the cost of books. Access to books created a new culture of reading. Earlier reading was restricted to the elite.</li>
<li>Common people lived in a world of oral culture. They heard sacred texts read out, ballads recited and folk tales narrated. Knowledge was transferred orally.</li>
<li>Printers began publishing popular ballads and folk tales, illustrated with pictures. These were sung and recited at gatherings. Oral culture thus entered print and printed material was orally transmitted.</li>
<li>The line that separated oral and reading cultures diminished and the hearing and reading public intermingled.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 22.<br />
Highlight any three innovations which have improved the printing technology from nineteenth century onwards. (2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
Three innovations which have improved the printing technology from nineteenth century onwards:</p>

<li>Methods of feeding paper improved.</li>
<li>The quality of printing plates became better.</li>
<li>Automatic paper reels and photoelectric controls of the colour register were introduced.</li>
<li>The accumulation of several individual mechanical improvements transformed the appearance of printed texts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 23.<br />
In which three ways did the printed books at first closely resemble the written manuscripts? (2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
The printed books at first closely resembled the written manuscripts in appearance and layout. The metal letters initiated the ornamental handwritten styles.</p>
<p>Borders were illuminated were by hand with foliage and patterns and illustrations painted.</p>
<p>In the books printed for the rich, space for decoration was kept blank on the printed page for the purchaser to choose the design and the painting school that would do the illustration.</p>
<p>Question 24.<br />
How did new forms of popular literature appear in print targeting new audience in the Eighteenth century? Explain with examples. (2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
New forms of popular literature appeared in print targeting new audiences.<br />
Book sellers employed pedlars who roamed around villages, carrying little books for sale. There were almanacs or ritual calendars, along with ballads and folktales.</p>
<p>In England, penny chapbooks were carried by petty pedlars known as chapmen and sold for a penny.<br />
In France &#8216;Biliotheque Blue&#8217;, low priced small books printed on poor quality paper were bound in cheap blue covers. Romances and the &#8216;histories&#8217; which were stories about the past were printed on four to six pages.</p>
<p>Books were of various sizes, serving many different purposes and interests.</p>
<p>Question 25.<br />
What made the Englishmen, under colonial rule, demand a clamp down on the &#8216;native press&#8217;, after the revolt of 1857? How was it done? (2013)<br />
Or, Why did the attitude of the colonial Government towards the freedom of the press change after the revolt of 1857? What repressive measures were adopted by them to control the freedom of press? (2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
The English Government wanted to suppress the native press because the vernacular newspapers had become assertively nationalist. They feared that if their freedom of Press is not curtailed, it might encourage the masses to rise again against the colonial rule.</p>
<p>In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed which provided the Government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press.</p>
<p>Then onwards, the government kept regular track of the vernacular newspapers published in different provinces. When a report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if the warning was ignored, the Press could be seized and the printing machinery confiscated.</p>
<p>Question 26.<br />
Why was Martin Luther in favour of print? Explain three reasons. (2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Martin Luther was in favour of print and spoke out in praise of it, because:</p>
<ol>
<li>He wrote &#8216;Ninety-Five Theses&#8217; criticizing many of the practices and rituals of the Roman Catholic Church. His ideas were reproduced in print in vast numbers and reached a large section of people,</li>
<li>According to him printing was the ultimate gift of God and the greatest one.</li>
<li>His protests ultimately led to the division of Church and beginning of the Protestant Reformation.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 27.<br />
Write a short note on Gutenberg Press. (2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Gutenberg Press. A breakthrough in print technology occurred at Strasbourg, Germany where Johann Gutenberg developed the first known printing press in 1430s. Gutenberg developed metal types for each of the 26 characters of the Roman alphabet and devised a way of moving them around so as to compose different words of the text.</p>
<p>This came to be known as the moveable type printing machine, and it remained the basic print technology over the next 300 years. Books could now be produced much faster than was possible when each print block was prepared by carving a piece of wood by hand. The Gutenberg press could print 250 sheets on one side per hour. The first book printed by Gutenberg was the Bible and it took three years to print 180 copies.</p>
<p>Question 28.<br />
Write a short note on Vernacular Press Act. (2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
The Vernacular Press Act.</p>
<ul>
<li>In 1878, the Vernacular Press Act was passed by the British Government in India to impose restrictions on vernacular press, which was responsible for spreading nationalist ideas in much of India.</li>
<li>The government started to keep a regular track of the vernacular newspapers published in different provinces and had extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the vernacular press.</li>
<li>When a report was judged as seditious, the newspaper was warned, and if the warning was ignored, the press was liable to be seized and the printing machinery confiscated.</li>
<li>The most discriminating aspect of the law was that though it put serious restrictions on the freedom of Indian language newspapers, yet it spared the English newspapers from its purview.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 29.<br />
Why did some people in the eighteenth century Europe think that print culture would bring enlightenment and end despotism?<br />
Answer:<br />
By mid-eighteenth century, people started believing that books were a means of spreading progress and enlightenment. They believed books could change the world and liberate society from despotism and tyranny. Thinkers hoped that widespread use of books would help people to reason out and give them strength to fight despotism. The knowledge imparted in the books would help the masses to Question the rights of the rulers (or divine right theory). Louise Sebastien Mercier, a novelist staunchly believed that the power of print would spread enlightenment and destroy the very basis of despotism.</p>
<p>Question 30.<br />

<p>Long Answer Questions (LA) 5 Marks</p>
<p>Question 33.<br />
Why did the British Government pass the Vernacular Press Act in 1878? What powers did it give to the Government? (2012)<br />
Or<br />
Critically examine the Vernacular Press Act of 1878. (2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
The British Government passed the Vernacular Press Act in 1878 because the Company was worried that their criticism in Indian media might be used by their critics in England to attack their trade monopoly in India.</p>
<p>After the Revolt of 1877, the criticism against the government grew in the Indian media. The Vernacular newspapers reported on colonial misrule and encouraged nationalist activities. So it became necessary for the administrators in India to suppress the local newspapers. It provided the government with extensive rights to censor reports and editorials in the Vernacular Press.</p>
<p>The government had the power to warn, seize and confiscate the printing machinery of the newspaper if it was judged as seditious. The most discriminating aspect was that it put severe restrictions on the Indian language newspapers while the English ones were spared from its purview.</p>
<p>Question 34.<br />
What is a manuscript? List any four shortcomings of manuscripts. (2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
India had a very rich and old tradition of handwritten manuscripts—in Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian and other vernacular languages.<br />
Manuscripts were copied on palm leaves or on handmade paper. Pages were sometimes beautifully . illustrated.<br />
Shortcomings of manuscript:</p>
<ol>
<li>Manuscripts were highly expensive and fragile and could not be carried around easily.</li>
<li>They could not be read easily as the script was written in different styles.</li>
<li>Production of handwritten manuscripts could not satisfy the ever-increasing demand for books.</li>
<li>Copying was an expensive, laborious and time-consuming business.</li>

Or<br />
Evaluate the impact of print technology on the poor people in India. (2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
The effects of spread of print culture on poor people in 19th century India:<br />
Very cheap books were brought to markets in 19th century Madras towns and sold at crossroads, allowing poor people travelling to markets to buy them. Public libraries were set up from the 20th century, expanding access to books.</p>
<p>From the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, issues of caste discrimination began to be written about in many printed tracts and essays.</p>
<ul>
<li>Jyotiba Phule, the Maratha pioneer of &#8216;low caste&#8217; protest movements, wrote about the injustices of the caste system in his Gulamgiri (1871). B.R. Ambedkar in Maharashtra and E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker in Madras, better known as Periyar, wrote powerfully on caste and their writings were read by people all over India.</li>

</ol>
<p>Question 40.<br />
How far is it right to say that the print culture was responsible for the French Revolution? Explain. (2014)<br />
Or<br />
&#8220;Many historians argued that the conditions within which French Revolution occurred were created by the print culture&#8221;. Support this statement with three suitable arguments. (2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
Following are the arguments which were given in support of the above statement:</p>
<ol>
<li>Print popularised the ideas of enlightened thinkers like Voltaire and Rousseau, and those who read these books, started Question ing everything and developed critical and rational thinking. These thinkers attacked the sacred authority of the Church and despotic power of the State.</li>
<li>All existing values, norms and institutions, which were never Question ed earlier, were revalued through debates and discussions by the public in print.</li>
<li>By 1780s, there was an outpour of literature that mocked royalty and criticised their morality. The existing social order was criticised. Through cartoons and caricatures, they made people aware that while common people were going through tremendous hardships, the monarchy remained absorbed in merry-making and did not care about sufferings of common people. This ultimately led to the growth of a hostile feeling against the monarchy.<br />
In spite of these strong arguments, no one can claim that these were the only reasons for the outbreak of the French Revolution.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 41.<br />
What did the spread of print culture mean to the women in 19<sup>th</sup> century India.<br />
Answer:<br />
Women: The spread of print culture opened a new world of education and books for many Indian women who had remained confined to their households and families due to the traditional Indian social set-up.</p>
<ul>
<li>Women&#8217;s reading increased enormously in middle-class homes. Liberal husbands and fathers began educating their womenfolk at home and sent them to schools when women&#8217;s schools were set up in the cities and towns after the mid-nineteenth century.</li>
<li>Even girls and women took initiative to get liberated and educated. One such example is of a girl in a conservative Muslim family of North India who had learnt to read and write Urdu. Her family wanted her to read only the Arabic Quran which she did not understand. So she insisted on learning to read a language that was her own.</li>
<li>Another such example was: Rashsundari Debi, a young married girl in a very orthodox household who learnt to read in the secrecy of her kitchen. Later she wrote her autobiography Amur Jiban which was published in 1876.</li>
<li>From 1860, a few Bengali women like Kailashbashini Debi wrote books highlighting the experiences of women about how they were illtreated on the domestic front.</li>
<li>Tarabai Shinde and Pandita Ramabai wrote with passionate anger about the miserable lives of upper caste Hindu women, especially widows. A woman in a Tamil novel expressed what reading meant to women: &#8216;For various reasons, my world is small. More than half my life&#8217;s happiness has come from books.&#8217;</li>
<li>In the early twentieth century, journals, written for and sometimes edited by women, became extremely popular and discussed issues like women&#8217;s education, widowhood, widow remarriage and the national movement.</li>
<li>Pedlars took the Battala publications (Central Calcutta) to homes, enabling women to read them in their leisure time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 42.<br />
Explain the significance of newspapers and journals developed from the early 18<sup>th</sup> century.<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>By the close of the eighteenth century, a number of newspapers and journals appeared in print.</li>
<li>Not just the English people, the Indians too began to publish Indian newspapers.</li>
<li>The first newspaper to come out was the weekly Bengal Gazette, brought out by Gangadhar Bhattacharya.</li>
<li>Printed tracts and newspapers not only spread new ideas, but they also shaped the nature of debate. A wider public could now participate in public discussions and express their views.</li>
<li>There were intense controversies between the social and religious reformers and Hindu orthodoxy over matters like widow immolation, monotheism, Brahmanical priesthood and idolatory. So that these ideas and thoughts could reach a wider audience, newspapers were printed in the spoken language of ordinary people.</li>
<li>Rammohan Roy published the Sambad Kaumudi from 1821 and the Hindu orthodoxy commissioned the Samachar Chandrika to oppose his opinions.</li>
<li>Two Persian newspapers, Jam-i-Jahan Nama and Shamsul Akhbar were also published.</li>
<li>Newspapers and journals not only helped the publication of conflicting opinions but also connected people and communities in different parts of India. Newspapers conveyed news from one place to another, creating Pan-Indian identities.</li>
