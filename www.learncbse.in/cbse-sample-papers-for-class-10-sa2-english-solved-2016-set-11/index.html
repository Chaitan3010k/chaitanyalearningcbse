<p><strong>                                                                     SECTION A &#8211; Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">1. Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Ang Norbu&#8217;s mother Lhakpa Diki, the only woman high altitude guide in the 1940s, took up the profession of high altitude climbing guide after her husband Lobsang, a sherpa, went missing while accompanying two western mountaineers to Green Lake on the northern side of Mt. Kanchenjunga, in 1947. In an interview last year, Lhakpa, at 103, said: &#8216;I had seen what happened to Sherpa children who lost their fathers to the mountains.&#8217; Diki guided &#8216;sahibs&#8217; on treks in Sikkim, and the Singhalila Himalayas.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Darjeeling&#8217;s tryst with the Himalayas began with the Dalai Lama giving his consent to climb IVIount Everest from the Tibetan side, in response to a request by the British in 1921. As Nepal was closed to western mountaineers, expeditions were flagged off from Darjeeling to Mt Everest from the Northeast Ridge in Tibet. The utter poverty in the region drove many of the population to the lucrative profession of being a high-altitude porter. Back then, the expeditions relied largely on them. There were also infamous tales of porters suddenly refusing to carry provisions, thereby bringing expeditions to a grinding halt.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    The turning point came in 1949, with Nepal opening up to western mountaineers and Tibet closing its doors to foreigners, after the Second World War. With Tenzing Norgay&#8217;s ascent of Mt Everest, sherpas began getting recognition and education. In 1950, those who were in India, started getting jobs with the government and in banks. Some even became doctors. When the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute was founded, eight sherpas, including Tenzing Norgay, were sent to Switzerland to receive training to become formal instructors. Today, many of them have emigrated to America. Still others have diversified, choosing other adventure sports such as rock climbing trekking and para gliding. The present generation of sherpas would pursue mountain climbing as a hobby rather than take it up as a profession.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    Who is Lhakpa Diki?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    When did Diki take up the profession?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Why was climbing Mt. Everest done from the Tibetan side earlier?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Why were sherpas important for expeditions of yore?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    What events mark the turning point in mountain climbing in the region?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    How were expeditions routed when Nepal did not allow western climbers into its territory?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    Why was Tenzing sent to Switzerland?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    What occupations do present day sherpas take up?</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1 Often we are called upon to dress up for a fancy dress party. A novel option is to dress up and go as a Goth. The original Goths were Germanic people who played a decisive role in the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, earlier than the 4th century. Today, being a Goth has become synonymous with dressing in a particular way, being fond of darkness and music that is different from punk music.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2 For the fancy dress one should start with putting on dark make-up, sport an unusual hairstyle and wear clothes that are fashioned from black velvet, with bits of lace and fishnet fringes here and there. The more authentic look would consist of wearing leather jackets or belts tinged with streaks of scarlet, or purple, of laced gloves and lots of silver jewellery, specially lockets with images of occult figures or writings.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3 While most Goths wear black outfits one can even opt for dark red, violet, blue, green and even white.</span><span class="font5">The idea is that one should feel good for if one is not at ease within, then the Goth image will not come through authentically. On the T-shirts the images of your favourite band, paired with black jeans, would give the right touch. A leather jacket over the T-shirt, studded with brass buttons or tin tacks would be a perfect compliment to the Goth look. To ensure that you come home with the &#8216;best-dressed&#8217; prize, you could pull out an old shirt, strip off one shoulder or cut the sleeve so that it hangs in shreds, and show off your shoulders, like a true Goth!    ^</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    With the attire taken care of, it is time to turn one&#8217;s attention to footwear. Uniform shoes or sneakers are too ordinary. You must totter about on high heeled sandals without spraining your ankles.

<p><strong><span class="font5">1. Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Ang Norbu&#8217;s mother Lhakpa Diki, the only woman high altitude guide in the 1940s, took up the profession of high altitude climbing guide after her husband Lobsang, a sherpa, went missing while accompanying two western mountaineers to Green Lake on the northern side of Mt. Kanchenjunga, in 1947. In an interview last year, Lhakpa, at 103, said: &#8216;I had seen what happened to Sherpa children who lost their fathers to the mountains.&#8217; Diki guided &#8216;sahibs&#8217; on treks in Sikkim, and the Singhalila Himalayas.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Darjeeling&#8217;s tryst with the Himalayas began with the Dalai Lama giving his consent to climb IVIount Everest from the Tibetan side, in response to a request by the British in 1921. As Nepal was closed to western mountaineers, expeditions were flagged off from Darjeeling to Mt Everest from the Northeast Ridge in Tibet. The utter poverty in the region drove many of the population to the lucrative profession of being a high-altitude porter. Back then, the expeditions relied largely on them. There were also infamous tales of porters suddenly refusing to carry provisions, thereby bringing expeditions to a grinding halt.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    The turning point came in 1949, with Nepal opening up to western mountaineers and Tibet closing its doors to foreigners, after the Second World War. With Tenzing Norgay&#8217;s ascent of Mt Everest, sherpas began getting recognition and education. In 1950, those who were in India, started getting jobs with the government and in banks. Some even became doctors. When the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute was founded, eight sherpas, including Tenzing Norgay, were sent to Switzerland to receive training to become formal instructors. Today, many of them have emigrated to America. Still others have diversified, choosing other adventure sports such as rock climbing trekking and para gliding. The present generation of sherpas would pursue mountain climbing as a hobby rather than take it up as a profession.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    Who is Lhakpa Diki?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    When did Diki take up the profession?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Why was climbing Mt. Everest done from the Tibetan side earlier?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Why were sherpas important for expeditions of yore?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    What events mark the turning point in mountain climbing in the region?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    How were expeditions routed when Nepal did not allow western climbers into its territory?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    Why was Tenzing sent to Switzerland?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    What occupations do present day sherpas take up?</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">(a) Lhakpa Diki is the only woman high altitude guide of the 1940s.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    Diki took up the profession after her husband Lobsang, a sherpa, went missing while accompanying two western mountaineers.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Climhing Mt. Everest from the Tibetan side was done earlier because Nepal was closed to western mountaineers and expeditions were flagged off from Darjeeling from the Northeast Ridge in Tibet.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Sherpas were important for expeditions of yore because expeditions relied largely on them and if they refused to carry provisions, expeditions ground to a halt.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    The opening up of Nepal in 1949, to western mountaineers and Tibet closing its doors to foreigners, after the Second World War, marks the turning point in mountain climbing in this region.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    When Nepal was closed to western mountaineers, expeditions were flagged off from Darjeeling to Mt Everest from the Northeast Ridge in Tibet</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    Tenzing was sent to Switzerland to train as a formal instructor, as the Indian Mountaineering Institute had been started and instructors were needed for it.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    Today, sherpas h?ve emigrated to America, or diversified into rock climbing, para gliding and trekking, or else pursued mountain climbing as a hobby rather than a profession.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1 Often we are called upon to dress up for a fancy dress party. A novel option is to dress up and go as a Goth. The original Goths were Germanic people who played a decisive role in the fall of the Roman Empire in Europe, earlier than the 4th century. Today, being a Goth has become synonymous with dressing in a particular way, being fond of darkness and music that is different from punk music.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2 For the fancy dress one should start with putting on dark make-up, sport an unusual hairstyle and wear clothes that are fashioned from black velvet, with bits of lace and fishnet fringes here and there. The more authentic look would consist of wearing leather jackets or belts tinged with streaks of scarlet, or purple, of laced gloves and lots of silver jewellery, specially lockets with images of occult figures or writings.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3 While most Goths wear black outfits one can even opt for dark red, violet, blue, green and even white.</span><span class="font5">The idea is that one should feel good for if one is not at ease within, then the Goth image will not come through authentically. On the T-shirts the images of your favourite band, paired with black jeans, would give the right touch. A leather jacket over the T-shirt, studded with brass buttons or tin tacks would be a perfect compliment to the Goth look. To ensure that you come home with the &#8216;best-dressed&#8217; prize, you could pull out an old shirt, strip off one shoulder or cut the sleeve so that it hangs in shreds, and show off your shoulders, like a true Goth!    ^</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    With the attire taken care of, it is time to turn one&#8217;s attention to footwear. Uniform shoes or sneakers are too ordinary. You must totter about on high heeled sandals without spraining your ankles. Alternately borrow a pair of knee length black boots, wear it over your fitting black jeans and smarten it up with brass buckles and studs 1</span><span class="font5">6</span><span class="font5"> give the correct look.

<span class="font5">(c)    For creating the look from one&#8217;s current wardrobe one must tear off the sleeve of an old short to expose the shoulders or else, wear T-shirts with images of one&#8217;s favourite band and team it with tight-fitting black jeans.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Footwear consists of stilettos or high boots worn over jeans. Hairstyling with wigs can be done by dyeing it a coppery colour and ruffling it to look unkempt. Sporting black painted nails, a compulsory identification mark, completes the look.</span><br />

<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">Protecting the environment is not unidirectional. Thus, while we need to create mass environment-friendly transport facilities, we also need to conserve natural resources such as solar and wind power. But, before we begin to exploit our natural resources we have to learn to regulate use of existing resources.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Besides developing and cpnsuming energy we need to save so that ogr future generations don&#8217;t suffer because of our extravagant practices. No one can dispute the need to save water in order to save energy consumption. Mining activities also need to be properly controlled so that industries are not affected, the environment protected and the pace of living maintained.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Managing waste that we humans produce can only be carried out by adopting a campaign of reduce, re-use and recycle, in every walk of life. Our guiding motto therefore should be that we should not exploit the Earth which nourishes us today and our future generations tomorrow.</span><br />

<span class="font5">In Mumbai, I had a chance to see the newly established Museum of Indian Cinema. It is housed in a period building in the central part of the city and is very popular with visitors in the land of Bollywood. It contains artifacts that relate to our motion picture heritage.</span><br />
<span class="font5">The technology behind motion picture making was clearly evident there. There were several of old cameras on display, some of them still in working order. The preservation process included digital formatting of several old films. The artifacts were also protected against further damage by humidity control methods. The visit was an eye-opener and proved that the old and the new can live in perfect harmony when technology is used to restore and maintain our past.</span></p>

<span class="font5">Jagjit was popular with his classmates as he pretended to know magic, particularly the disappearing act. He would pretend to &#8216;find&#8217; his friends&#8217; things with his magic skills. He was also smart enough to hide away a few items which he never returned and later pawned or sold to buy himself fanciful things like new gaming CDs. No one really complained as he was a glib talker and would convince his friends about how he had compensated them for the items as he never charged for his shows!</span><br />
<span class="font5">Becoming brazen, Jagjit appropriated his teacher&#8217;s mobile and Jagjit had pawned it in exchange for a front row seat at the international cricket tournament. But that evening Jagjit could not enjoy the match. His classmates had informed their teacher about him.</span><br />

He explained to Sudhir what a postmark signified and he had a few stamps that had been released by foreign countries. Though his grandfather had not travelled to those countries, he often related how the stamp of a country could link with its history, its lifestyle and even its leaders.</span><br />
<span class="font5">When his grandfather had passed away, his parents had given the collection to Sudhir to keep. At first Sudhir was excited and maintained the collection in the way his grandfather had done, but as studies became more timeconsuming, Sudhir began to neglect the collection. On his mother&#8217;s advice, Sudhir decided to post his collection on facebook. He chose a particularly colourful old stamp from British Guiana to illustrate his page. Imagine his surprise when Sudhir found that an international firm of auctioneers proposed buying up the collection.</span><br />
<span class="font5">The buyer came to their home and with his parents&#8217; permission, Sudhir showed him his grandfather&#8217;s collection. Sudhir&#8217;s family set up a school in the old post office building funded from the proceeds of that unique sale.</span></p>

<span class="font5">And a good south wind sprung up behind,</span><span class="font6">    </span><br />

<span class="font5">And everday, for food or play,</span><br />
<span class="font5">Came to the mariner&#8217;s hollo!</span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    Why does the poet call south wind to be good?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What is the meaning of </span><span class="font5">‘hollo<sup>1</sup>?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What was the sailors&#8217; attitude towards the bird?</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">You knew not what you do, do not consent That Antony speak in his funeral. Know you how much the people may be moved.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    Why didn&#8217;t Cassius want Antony to speak in Caesar&#8217;s funeral?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What were Brutus&#8217; views on Cassius remark?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What is the meaning of &#8216;</span><span class="font5">consent</span><span class="font5">?</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">(a) The poet called &#8216;south wind&#8217; to be good because it helped in steering the ship in the right direction. The </span><span class="font5">sailors wanted to go northwards and the wind helped them.</span><br />

<p><strong><span class="font5">9.    Answer </span><span class="font5">any </span><span class="font5">four of the following questions in 30-40 words each.</span></strong><br />

<span class="font5">(b)    What was Michael&#8217;s theory about Sebastian&#8217;s entering into the game?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Why did Brutus kill Caesar?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    How does the Mariner describe the movement of the ship as it sails away from the land?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    How do we know that Patol Babu was a meticulous man?</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">(a) The poet says so because he liked the snake but the voices of his education told him to kill the snake though </span><span class="font5">it didn&#8217;t harm him in any way. The poet threw a log of wood at the snake and the snake hurriedly moved back into its hole. Seeing this the poet felt ashamed and he felt that his action of trying to kill the harmless snake was petty and mean.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    Michael came to know that Sebastian had met with an accident when he was playing one of the same Psychodrive games on his laptop that Michael even had on his own laptop. Sebastian&#8217;s computer was logged on when he banged his head on it when he met with an accident. The computer had saved his memory its own.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Brutus killed Caesar because he advocated the freedom of the Romans. The conspirators convinced him that Caesar wanted to make Romans slaves. So, he was a threat to democracy in Rome. Brutus couldn&#8217;t see through the evil plans of the conspirators. Thus he became a part of the conspiracy and killed Caesar.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    The mariner describes the movement of the ship as it sails away from the land in the following words. This ship is going farther and farther towards the horizon. First of all, the ship appears to be going below the kirk, then below the hill. Finally, the ship is so far away that it appears to be even below the lighthouse top.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Patol Babu had been asked to walk down the road .and bump into the hero and utter the word &#8216;Oh!&#8217;. He practised this many times because he wanted to get it right. He did not have a casual attitude towards this small role.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">Patol Babu did his small role with dedication but he decided not to wait for the money though he badly needed it. Write a letter to your friend who always shirks work and thirtks his work is a burden on him. Tell him the importance of dedication, satisfaction and commitment while doing any task.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Ozymandias is a masterful sonnet because of its imagery and the theme. Elaborate.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Value Points:</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">•    Hard work and dedication are very necessary.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Many roadblocks on the &#8216;road to success&#8217; but these can be surmounted with hard work.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Never shirk work because nature also maintains its rhythm by doing all its things on time.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    In today&#8217;s world of fast competition if one is not hardworking, one lags behind in the race of life.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    We should put in our best efforts.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Ozymandias&#8221; is a masterful sonnet Essentially it is devoted to a single metaphor: the shattered, ruined statue in the desert wasteland, with its arrogant, passionate face and monomaniacal inscription (&#8220;Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!&#8221;). The once-great king&#8217;s proud boast has been ironically disproved; Ozymandias&#8217;s works have crumbled and disappeared, his civilization is gone, all has been turned to dust by the impersonal, indiscriminate, destructive power of history. The ruined statue is now merely a monument to one man&#8217;s hubris, and a powerful statement about the insignificance of human beings to the passage of time. Ozymandias is first and foremost a metaphor for the ephemeral nature of political power, Shelley demonstrates that art and language long outlast the other legacies of power. Of course, it is Shelley&#8217;s brilliant poetic rendering of the story, and not the subject of the story itself, which makes the poem so memorable. Framing the sonnet as a story told to the speaker by &#8220;a traveller from an antique land&#8221; enables Shelley to add another level of obscurity to Ozymandias&#8217;s position with regard to the reader—rather than seeing the statue with our own eyes, so to speak, we hear about it from someone who heard about it from someone who has seen it.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font7">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Mr. Koophius.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font5">Anne considered her diary to be her closest friend and confidant. She would often feel happy that she could give a vent to all her anger, negative feelings and sadness in her diary. She could share her positive thoughts, views about other people and could openly write anything she felt like sharing. The diary possessed an important place in Anne&#8217;s life. She said that she would never part with her diary. Anne felt lonely and expressed all her feelings in it. She was scared of what could happen if her diary was seen by the German police. She valued it a lot and it was precious to her. Anne Frank started keeping a diary from her thirteenth birthday. She took the diary to the hiding place, of course. Anne entered the Secret Annex as a girl, but grew into a young woman there. She spent more time thinking about life, and recorded her thoughts in her diary. Anne didn&#8217;t just keep a diary during her time in the Secret Annex. She also wrote short stories and collected her favourite sentences by other writers in a notebook. Anne hoped for her diary to be published as a novel after the war. That&#8217;s why she started rewriting it. But Anne never managed to finish it. She was discovered and arrested before she had completed her work.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Mr Koophius was the Dutch partner of Mr. Frank in the business. He provided the family with food and clothing with keeping the whereabouts secret by turning off people by pretending to have left behind the keys to their entrance when the warehouse was sold by its owner. He was a sickly man and had a stomach ulcer. He was let off by the police due to his health when the members of the hideout were captured by the German police.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font5">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Kate Keller.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">Helen had a special love for her books. She depended on books not only for pleasure but for the wisdom, they brought to all who read them. Indeed, books have meant so much more in her education than in that of others. Sometimes, Miss Sullivan read to her. She preferred reading herself to being read to. She spent a part of each day in the Institution library and took down whatever book her fingers lighted upon. She loved all kind of books. She read the books in the intervals between study and play. Her only purpose was to get pleasure out of them. She did not analyse the books. She never thought about their style or authorship. She accepted them in a natural way. She accepted them as we accept the sunshine and love of our friends.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Kate Keller was Helen&#8217;s mother. She was the first person in the life of Keller. She was an early source of comfort to Helen Keller. As a mother, she could feel the pangs of a troubled child. She was always with Helen and provided her all the love and support. Kate Keller learned the manual alphabet from Anne Sullivan so that she could communicate effectively with her daughter. She was a beautiful, tall and fair complexioned lady and was intelligent and blessed with an excellent memory. She was very supportive and had a positive attitude. As a mother, she sometimes felt threatened by Sullivan. She found that Helen was very close to her teacher. However, soon she understood that for the sake of her daughter that deep-bounded student-teacher relationship was necessary. She i$ a wonderful character in the novel.</span></p>
