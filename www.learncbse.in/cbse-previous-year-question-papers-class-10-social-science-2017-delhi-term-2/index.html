Answer:<br />
&#8216;Political Parties&#8217; perform the following functions in a democracy:<br />
(i) Parties contest elections: In most of the democratic countries, elections are fought mainly among the candidates put up by the political parties. Parties select their candidates in different ways in India. Top party leaders choose candidates for contesting elections.</p>
<p>(ii) Parties put forward different policies and programmes: Each one may have different opinion and views on what policies are suitable for society. In democracy, large number of similar opinions are grouped together to provide a direction in which policies can be formulated by the government. Making these policies is the function of political parties. The government is expected to make its policies on the time taken by the ruling party.</p>
<p>(iii) Parties make laws for the country: Though laws are passed by the legislature but since most of the members belong to a party, they go by the direction of party leadership, irrespective of their personal opinions.</p>
<p>(iv) Parties form and run government: Political parties recruit leaders, train them and make them ministers to run the government in the way they want.</p>
<p>(v) Parties play role of the opposition to the parties in power: They voice different views and criticise government for its failures or wrong policies. Opposition parties also mobilise opposition to the government.</p>
<p>(vi) Parties shape public opinion: They shape public opinion byraising and highlighting issues. They do these through pressure groups,which are the extensions of political parties and also launch movements for resolutions of problems faced by the people.</p>
<p>(vii) Parties provide people access to government welfare schemes: For an ordinary citizen, it is easier to approach a local party leader than a government officer. They feel close to party even if they do not fully trust them. Even parties have to be responsive to the people&#8217;s needs and demands otherwise people can reject the parties in next elections.</p>
<p>Question 27.<br />

Ailswer:<br />
Any market needs rules and regulations because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual consumer often find themselves in a weak position. In case of complaint regarding a good or service that had been bought, the seller tries to shift all the responsibility on to the buyer.</li>
<li>Sometimes traders indulge in unfair trade practices such as, when shopkeepers weigh less than what they should.</li>
<li>Markets do not work in a fair manner when producers are few and powerful. A long battle had to be fought with court cases to make cigarette manufacturing companies accept that cigarette causes cancer.</li>
<li>Large companies with huge weaiuL, power and reach can manipulate the market in various ways. At times, false information is passed on through the media and other sources to attract consumers.</li>
<li>Consumers are also exploited when they purchase in small amount and are scattered. For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over the world as the most scientific product claiming it to be better than mother&#8217;s milk. It took years of struggle before the company was forced to accept that it had been making false claims.</li>

<p>Question 25.<br />
Examine the main &#8216;challenges&#8217; before &#8216;political parties.&#8217; [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
The major challenges posed before political parties are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of internal democracy: ordinary members do not get sufficient information about what it going on within the party. The leader has greater power and tends to rule the party.</li>
<li>Dynastic succession: Generally, members of a family tend to rule the party. Eg: Nehru (Gandhi) family rule the congress party.</li>
<li>Money and muscle power: As parties are only interested in winning power they nominate those candidates who have or can<br />
raise a lot of money such as Rich people, businessmen, and criminals.</li>
<li>They do not offer a meaningful choice to the voters as many parties are different in their policies and ideologies. Sometimes, people cannot even elect different leaders as the same set of leaders keep changing their parties.</li>
<li>Casteism and religion in politics by parties: When one religion is pitted against another, by the political parties, this is called communalism or communal politics. Some parties or politicians promote the cause of the majority religious group at the cost of minorities. This produces a dangerous trend of majority tyranny.</li>
</ul>
