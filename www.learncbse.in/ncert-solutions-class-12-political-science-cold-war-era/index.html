3. Locations from where they could spy on each other.<br />
4. Economic support to pay their military expenses.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. Sometimes it is said that the Cold War was a simple struggle for power and that ideology had nothing to do with it. Do</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> you agree with this? Give one example to support your position.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Yes, the Cold War was a simple struggle for power and that ideology had nothing to do with it because:<br />
1. The Cold War led to several shooting wars but this did not lead to another World War.<br />
2. Despite direct confrontations in Korea (1950-53), Berlin (1958-62), the Congo (early 1960s), neither alliance system crossed certain limits.<br />
3. Many lives have been lost in some of the arenas like Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan but World War spread a nuclear war or global hostilities.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>8. What was India’s foreign policy towards the USandUSSR during the Cold War era? Do you think that this policy helped India’s interests?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> India’s foreign policy towards the US and USSR was two fold:<br />
1. Took particular care in staging away from the two alliances.<br />
2. Raised voice against the newly decolonised countries becoming part of these alliances.<br />
3. Moreover, India tried to reduce the differences and rivalries between these alliances from escalating into a full scale war.<br />
Yes, this policy served India’s interests also:<br />
1. Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions that served India’s interests rather than interests of superpowers and its allies.<br />
2. India maintained a balance between two superpowers as if India felt ignored by one superpower it could tilt towards other superpowers.<br />
3. Neither the alliance could take India for granted.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>9. NAM was considered a ‘third option’ by third world countries! How did this option benefit their growth during the peak of the Cold War?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Non-alignment offered newly decolonised countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America, a third option—not to join either alliance. A majority of NAM members was categorised as the Least Development Countries (LDCs), to be developed more economically not to remain dependent on richer countries. A new International Economic Order (NIEO) originated with this realisation. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled towards a New Trade Policy for Development which proposed a reform of global trading system:<br />
1. LDCs got control over their own natural resources which were being exploited by developed western countries.<br />
2. To make western market available for LDCs to make trade more beneficial.<br />
3. To reduce cost of-technology from western countries.<br />
4. To provide LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>10. What do you th nk about the statement that NAM has bdcoPie irrelevant today? Give reasons to support your opinion.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Or</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> What is the relevance of non-aligned movement after the end of Cold War?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> By the mid 1970s, NAM had become an economic pressure group and by late 1980s, the NIEO initiative had faded due to stiff competition from developed countries who acted as a united group while non-aligned countries struggled to maintain their unity in face of this opposition. Non-alignment both as an international movement and as a core of India’s foreign policy lost some of its earlier relevance. Though non-alignment contained some core values and enduring ideas. It was based on a recognition that decolonised states shared a historical affiliation and can become powerful force if they come together, as very small and poor countries need not to become follower of any big powers instead they could persue an independent foreign policy also.<br />
In nutshell, it can be concluded that NAM has not lost its relevance. It has stood test of adverse circumstances. It has served an important purpose of protecting and preserving interests of third world countries.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Short Answer Type Questions [4 Marks]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Why did India distance itself from the two camps led by the U.S. and the Soviet Union? Explain.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The end of the Second World War was the beginning of the Cold War between the two superpowers of the world, namely the US and the USSR. These two superpowers were keen on expanding their spheres of influence in different parts of the world. Most countries of western Europe sided with the US and those of eastern Europe joined the USSR. But India kept a distance from these superpowers. It means, it became a member of the non-alignment-movement by not joining either alliance. Non-alignment was not a noble international cause which had little to do with India’s real interests. A non-aligned posture also served India’s interests very directly, in at least two ways.<br />
(t) Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions and stances that served its interests rather than the interests of the superpowers and their allies. .<br />
(ii) India was often able to balance one superpower against the other. If India felt ignored or unduly pressurised by one superpower, it could tilt towards the other. Neither alliance system could take India for granted or bully it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>2. “The drop of bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the US was a political game.” Justify the statement.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The Second World War ended when the United States dropped two atomic bombs on Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 causing Japan to surrender. Moreover, this action was criticised on the ground that the US knew that Japan was about to surrender and dropping of bombs was not necessary. US action was intended to stop Soviet Union from making military and political gains in Asia and elsewhere and to show that the US was supreme.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>3. Explain the Cuban Missile Crisis.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> In 1962, Soviet Union decided to convert Cuba into a Russian base as it provided USSR diplomatic and financial aid both. Hence, Soviet Union placed nuclear missiles in Cuba. The US became aware of it and ordered American warships to intercept to Soviet Union to remove missiles to avoid full scale nuclear war. A clash seemed imminent what came to be known as Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4. Name any two founders of Non-aligned Movement. The first NAM summit was the culmination of which three factors?</strong></span><br />

1. Indonesia’s Sukarno and<br />
2. Ghana’s Kwame Nkrumah<br />
The first NAM was held in Belgrade in 1961. This was the culmination of following three factors:<br />
1. Cooperation among member countries.<br />

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>5. What is the rationale of Non-aligned movement after the end of Cold War?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Or</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Whmh core values keep non-alignment relevant even after Cold War has ended?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Non-aligned Movement was based on a recognition that decolonised states shared a historical affiliation and can become powerful force if they come together. It meant that very small and poor countries need not become followers of any big power, instead they could persue an independent foreign policy also. It was based on a resolve to democratise the international system to redress existing inequities also.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>6. “ Non-alignment posture was in the interest of India”. How?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Non-alignment posture was in the interest of India because:<br />
1. Non-alignment allowed India to take international decisions to serve her own interests.<br />
2. India maintained a balance between two superpowers as if India felt ignored by one. India would tilt towards other superpower.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. How did deterrence relationship prevented war between two superpowers?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> 1. Even if one of them tries to attack and disable the nuclear weapons of its rivals, the other would still be left with enough nuclear weapons to inflict unacceptable destruction.<br />
2. Both sides have capacity to retaliate against an attack and to cause so much destruction that neither can afford to initiate war.<br />
3. Both superpowers were expected to behave more rationally and in responsible manner in the sense that they understood the risks in fighting wars which may create a massive destruction.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Long Answer Type Questions [6 Marks]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Describe any six factors responsible for the disintegration of USSR.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Or</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> What is meant by New International Economic Order? Mention any four reforms of the global trading system proposed by UNCTAD in 1972.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Six factors responsible for the disintegration of USSR are—<br />
(i) The internal weaknesses of Soviet political and economic institutions failed to meet the aspirations of the people.<br />
(ii) Economic stagnation for many years led to severe consumer shortages and a large section of Soviet society began to doubt and question the system and to do so openly.<br />
(iii) The Soviet Union had become stagnant in an administrative and political sense as well. The Communist Party that had ruled the Soviet Union for over 70 years was not accountable to the people. Ordinary people were alienated by slow and stifling administration, rampant corruption, the inability of the system to correct mistakes it had made, the unwillingness to allow more openness in government and the centralisation of authority in a-vast land.<br />
(iv) The Soviet economy used much of its resources in maintaining a nuclear and military arsenal and the development of its satellite states in Eastern Europe and within the Soviet system. This led a huge economic burden that the system could not cope with.<br />
(v) When Gorbachev became the President, he carried out reforms and loosened the system. He set in motion forces and expectations that few could have predicted and became virtually impossible to control. There were sections of Soviet society which felt that Gorbachev should have moved much faster and were disappointed and impatient with his methods. Others, especially members of the Communist Party and those who were served by the system, took exactly the opposite view. In this tug of war, Gorbachev lost support on all sides.<br />
(vi) The rise of nationalism and the desire for sovereignty within various republics including Russia and the Baltic Republics, Ukraine, Georgia, and others proved to be the final and most immediate cause for the disintegration of the USSR.<br />
Or<br />
The non-aligned countries were more than merely mediators during the&#8217; Cold War. The challenge for most of the non-aligned countries — a majority of them were categorised as the Least<br />
Developed Countries (LDCs) — was to be more developed economically and to lift their people out of poverty. Economic development was also vital for the independence of the new countries. Without sustained development, a country could not be truly free. It would remain dependent on the richer countries including the colonial powers from which political freedom had been achieved. The idea of a New International Economic Order (NIEO) originated with this realisation.<br />
The UNCTAD brought out a report in 1972 entitled Towards a New Trade Policy for Development. The report proposed a reform of the global trading system so as to:<br />
(i) give the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) control over their natural resources exploited by the developed western countries.<br />
(ii) obtain access to western markets so that LDCs would sell their products and, therefore, make trade more beneficial for the poorer countries.<br />
(iii) reduce the cost of technology from the western countries, and<br />
(iv) provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institutions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>2. What led to the emergence of bipolar world? What were the arenas of Cold War between the two power blocs?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Emergence of bipolar world:<br />
1. Two superpowers expanded their own spheres of influence in different parts of the world.<br />
2. It divided the world into two alliances namely Western and Eastern alliance headed by the US and Soviet Union respectively.<br />
3. The smaller states in alliances got the promise of protection of weapons and economic aid against their local rivals, hence they remained tied to its protective superpowers to limit influence of other superpower and its allies.<br />
Arenas of Cold War:<br />
1. Crisis and war occurred between alliance systems but did not cross certain limits.<br />
