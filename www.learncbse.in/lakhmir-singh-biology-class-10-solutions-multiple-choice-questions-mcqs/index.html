<p>Question 1.<br />
In the sketch of the stomatal apparatus given alongside, which one of the following is missing?<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123731" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-1.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) 1" width="239" height="190" /><br />
(1) Cell membranes of the cells<br />
(2) Cell walls of the cells<br />
(3) Nuclei in the guard cells<br />
(4) Chloroplasts in the guard cells<br />
Answer:<br />
The nuclei in the guard cells is missing from the sketch of the stomatal apparatus given above.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
A student focussed the leaf epidermal peel under the low power of microscope but could not see all the parts. He should .<br />
(1) use the coarse adjustment knob again to focus the slide.<br />
(2) use the fine adjustment knob to increase magnification.<br />
(3) focus under high power using coarse adjustment knob.<br />
(4) focus under high power using fine adjustment knob.<br />
Answer:<br />
In order to view all the parts of a leaf epidermal peel, the student should focus it under high power using fine adjustment knob. Cells are microscopic structures which can be clearly observed only under high power. It also enables us to observe various other components of cells.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 4.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
The temporary mount of the leaf epidermal peel which looked pinkish red under the microscope was .<br />
(1) stained in acetocarmine and mounted in glycerine<br />
(2) stained in iodine and mounted in water<br />
(3) stained in safranin and mounted in glycerine<br />
(4) stained in methylene blue and mounted in water<br />
Answer:<br />
The temporary mount of leaf is stained with safranine and mounted with glycerine.<br />
Safranine is a dye which can be taken up by cells and gives them a pink colour. The cell as well as the background are both transparent and it is difficult to visualise the cells as such. Staining imparts colour to the cells or its components and enhances its contrast and makes it easier to see them under the microscope.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
A well stained leaf peel mount when observed under the high power of a microscope shows nuclei in .<br />
(1) only epidermal cells<br />
(2) only guard cells<br />
(3) guard cells and epidermal cells<br />
(4) guard cells, epidermal cells and stoma<br />
Answer:<br />
Only guard cells and epidermal cells will be visible under the high power of a microscope.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Which structure out of I, II, III and IV marked in the given diagram of the epidermal peel of leaf should be labelled as stoma?<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123732" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-2.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) 2" width="304" height="230" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-2.png 304w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-2-300x227.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /><br />
(1) I<br />
(2) II<br />
(3) III<br />
(4) IV<br />
Answer:<br />
Stoma/stomatal pore is an opening surrounded by guard cells. Structure III marked in the given diagram represents stoma.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
A student had drawn the diagram of stomata in a hurry, as shown alongside. He could not be given full marks as he.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123734" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-3.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) 3" width="258" height="160" /><br />
(1) forgot to draw nuclei in guard cells and also to label the diagram.<br />
(2) did not draw nuclei in guard cells and other cells.<br />
(3) should have drawn nuclei and chloroplasts in guard cells and nuclei in all epidermal cells.<br />
(4) did not label the stoma in the correct position.<br />
Answer:<br />
The student could not get full marks for his diagram because he should have drawn nuclei and chloroplasts in guard cells and nuclei in all epidermal cells.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Bottles containing the undermentioned liquids were available in the laboratory. Which liquid did a student use for putting a drop on the slide before placing the coverslip while preparing the temporary mount of leaf epidermal peel?<br />
(1) Water<br />
(2) Safranin<br />
(3) Glycerine<br />
(4) Iodine<br />
Answer:<br />
The student must have put a drop of glycerine on the slide before placing the coverslip on the slide. Glycerine is a viscous liquid which prevents the specimen from drying out and keeps it moist for longer duration. Also glycerine tends to refract light due to its refractive nature. As a result of which, the image appears clearer under the microscope.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
To prepare a good temporary mount of the petunia leaf peel showing many stomata, the student has to get the peel from the .<br />
(1) tip of the leaf<br />
(2) upper surface of the leaf<br />
(3) lower surface of the leaf<br />
(4) point of attachement of leaf to its petiole<br />
Answer:<br />
To prepare a good temporary mount, the student should take the peel from the lower surface of the leaf.<br />
Stomata are structures which help in gaseous exchange and are usually scattered on the lower surfaces of leaf.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
While preparing a good temporary mount of leaf peel to observe stomata, care should be taken to avoid.<br />
(1) adding glycerine to the slide<br />
(2) using water to wash the slide<br />
(3) having air bubbles in the slide<br />
(4) staining the peel with safranin<br />
Answer:<br />
A good temporary mount of leaf should be free of any air bubbles. These air bubbles lower the viewing resolution. Thus, all precautions should be taken to avoid having air bubbles in the slide.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>

The observation in figure II correlates with the observation. The covered part shows yellow colour whereas the exposed parts show blue black colour on testing with iodine. Presence of blue black colour indicates the synthesis of starch in that region.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 1.</p>
<p>Question 32.<br />
In an experiment to test the presence of starch in a leaf, the plucked leaf is first boiled in water for a few minutes. This is an important step in the experiment because it .<br />
(1) converts glucose made in the leaf into starch<br />
(2) dissolves chlorophyll present in the green leaf<br />
(3) extracts starch to destarch the leaf<br />
(4) makes the leaf more permeable to iodine solution<br />
Answer:<br />
In the above mentioned experiment, the plucked leaf is first boiled in water to extract the starch and destarch the leaf.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 33.<br />
Why is some KOH placed in a small test tube in the flask with germinating seeds in the experiment to demonstrate occurrence of respiration in germinating seeds?<br />
(1) To provide oxygen required by the seeds for respiration.<br />
(2) To absorb carbon dioxide and create partial vacuum in the flask.<br />
(3) To absorb water from the seeds to make them dry.<br />
(4) To make the air present in the flask alkaline.<br />
Answer:<br />
KOH is placed in the small tube to absorb carbon dioxide and create partial vacuum in the flask. This absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> by KOH creates partial vacuum in the flask resulting in increase in the water level in the bent tube.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 2.</p>
<p>Question 34.<br />
Which one of the following is the correct set of three precautions for setting up the experiment to demonstrate that carbon dioxide is evolved during respiration?<br />
(1) Air tight set up; delivery tube dips in water in beaker; flask has seeds which have just germinated.<br />
(2) Thread holding KOH test tube; air tight flask; delivery tube above surface of water in the beaker.<br />
(3) Germinated seeds under water in the flask; experimental set up not air tight; delivery tube above water level.<br />
(4) Delivery tube touching bottom of water; KOH test tube held by a thick wire; seeds covered by water.<br />
Answer:<br />
The precautions which should be taken &#8211;<br />
Air tight set up &#8211; an air tight set up is required, so that the CO<sub>2</sub> produced during respiration does not escape out<br />
Delivery tube dips in water in beaker &#8211; the delivery tube needs to touch the water, so that the water can rise in the tube when partial vacuum is created in the flask.<br />
Flask has seeds which have just germinated &#8211; germinated seeds will produce CO<sub>2</sub> during the experiment which is an important requirement for this experiment.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 1.</p>
<p>Question 35.<br />
The experimental set up shown here to demonstrate that ‘CO<sub>2</sub> is given out during respiration’, did not yield expected results because .<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123748" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Multiple-Choice-Questions-MCQs-10.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) 10" width="266" height="223" /><br />
(1) the flask was not air tight<br />
(2) there was no KOH in test tube in the flask<br />
(3) the delivery tube was dipped in water<br />
(4) the germinating seeds were not immersed in water<br />
Answer:<br />
The above experiment did not yield the desired results as there was no KOH tube in the flask. KOH absorbs CO<sub>2</sub> and creates partial vacuum in the flask which leads to increase in the water level in the delivery tube. The increase in the water level in the bent tube is an indication that<br />
CO<sub>2</sub> is produced during respiration.<br />
The correct set up is<br />

<p>Question 37.<br />
In the experiment to show that CO<sub>2 </sub>is given out during respiration by germinating seeds, the student uses.<br />
(1) Lime water<br />
(2) Alcohol<br />
(3) KOH solution<br />
(4) Iodine solution<br />
Answer:<br />
In the experiment to show that CO<sub>2</sub> is produced during respiration by germinating seeds, KOH solution is used. KOH solution is used to absorb the CO<sub>2</sub> produced during respiration which results in the creation of vacuum in the flask<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 38.<br />
The most appropriate reason for taking germinating seeds in the experiment to show that carbon dioxide is produced during respiration, is .<br />
(1) germinating seeds create high temperature<br />
(2) germinating seeds are easy to handle<br />
(3) germinating seeds are living things<br />
(4) germinating seeds are in dormant to state<br />
Answer:<br />
The most appropriate reason to take germinating seeds in this experiment is that germinating seeds are living things. Only living things show the process of respiration. Use of seeds for this experiment does not lead to any ethical issues and are also easier to work with as compared to animals.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 39.<br />
Before setting up an experiment to show that seeds release carbon dioxide during respiration, the seeds should be.<br />
(1) dried completely<br />
(2) boiled to make them soft<br />
(3) soaked in potassium hydroxide solution<br />
(4) kept moist till they germinate<br />
Answer:<br />
In the above mentioned experiment, the seeds need to be kept moist till they germinate. If the seeds are not kept moist, they would dehydrate and eventually die.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 4.</p>
<p>Question 40.<br />
Which of the following precautions are to be taken for a successful run of the experiment to show that carbon dioxide is given out during respiration?<br />
A. Cork should be air-tight<br />

The correct answer is .<br />
(1) A and B<br />
(2) A and C<br />
(3) A, B and C<br />
(4) A, B and D<br />
Answer:<br />
The precautions to be taken in the above experiment are &#8211;<br />
A. Cork should be air-tight so that the carbon dioxide produced during the process does not escape out.<br />
C. A small tube with freshly prepared KOH solution should be placed in the flask so that it can absorb the carbon dioxide produced and create a vacuum in the flask. This vacuum is necessary for the water level to rise in the bent tube.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 2.</p>
<p>Question 41.<br />
The chemical required in the experiment to show that carbon dioxide gas is released during respiration is.<br />
(1) potassium bicarbonate<br />
(2) potassium dichromate<br />
(3) potassium permanganate<br />
(4) potassium hydroxide<br />
Answer:<br />
The chemical required in the experiment to show that carbon dioxide gas is released during respiration is potassium hydroxide. Potassium hydroxide absorbs the carbon dioxide produced during the process of respiration and creates a vacuum in the flask.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 4.</p>

Answer:<br />
Percentage of water absorbed by raisins \(=\frac{W_{2}-W_{1}}{W_{1}} \times 100\)<br />
The percentage of water absorbed in the above case would be \(=\frac{(45-40) g}{40 g} \times 100\)<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 67.<br />
5 dry raisins were placed in each of the two beakers containing 50 mL of water. After four hours, the raisins were taken out and wiped. For calculating the percentage of water absorbed by raisins, the raisins should have been weighed.<br />
(1) only before placing in water<br />
(2) only after four hours of their being in water<br />
(3) both before and after placing in water<br />
(4) before and at intervals of every hours<br />
Answer:<br />
The formula for calculating the percentage of water absorbed<br />
So, for calculating the percentage of water absorbed by raisins, they should have been weighed both before and after placing in water.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 68.<br />
Raisins swell up after being placed in a beaker containing water for some time because .<br />
(1) the concentration of water in the cell sap is higher than the water in the beaker<br />
(2) the concentration of water in the cell sap is lower than the water in the beaker<br />
(3) the concentration of water in the cell sap is the same as that of water in the beaker<br />
(4) water inside the raisins passed out of them when placed in a beaker of water<br />
Answer:<br />
As the concentration of water inside the cell sap is lower, the water from beaker will move inside the cell sap resulting in the swelling of raisins. This process is termed as osmosis.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 2.</p>
<p>Question 69.<br />
A group of students performed an experiment to determine the percentage of water absorbed by raisins.The initial weight of raisins is 5 grams and final weight is 8 grams. The percentage of water absorbed will be .<br />
(1) 62.5<br />
(2) 160<br />
(3) 60<br />
(4) 20<br />
Answer:<br />
The percentage of water absorbed will be \(=\frac{\text { Final weight-Initial weight }}{\text { Initial weight }} \times 100\)<br />
\(=\frac{8-5}{5} \times 100=60 \%\)<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 70.<br />
If the weight of dry raisins is W1 and that of soaked raisins is W2 ,then the correct equation for calculating the percentage of water absorbed by raisins will be .<br />
(1) W1 &#8211; W2<br />
(2) W2 &#8211; W1<br />
(3) \(\frac{W_{2}-W_{1}}{W_{1}} \times 100\)<br />
(4) \(\frac{W_{1}-W_{2}}{W_{2}} \times 100\)<br />
Answer:<br />
The correct equation for calculating the percentage of water absorbed by raisins will be \(\frac{W_{2}-W_{1}}{W_{1}} \times 100\)<br />
where, W<sub>1</sub> = Initial weight of raisins<br />
W<sub>2</sub> = Final weight of raisins<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 3.</p>
<p>Question 71.<br />
In the experiment to show that carbon dioxide is produced during respiration by germinating seeds, the alkali solution kept in a small test-tube absorbs.<br />
(1) only O<sub>2</sub> gas<br />
(2) only CO<sub>2</sub> gas<br />
(3) both O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gases<br />
(4) neither O<sub>2</sub> nor CO<sub>2</sub> gases<br />
Answer:<br />
In the above mentioned experiment, the alkali (KOH) kept in a small test tube absorbs only CO<sub>2</sub> gas and creates partial vacuum in the flask.<br />
Hence, the correct answer is option 2.</p>
