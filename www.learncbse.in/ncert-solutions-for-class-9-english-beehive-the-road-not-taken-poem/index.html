<p>Question 3.<br />
Is there any difference between the two roads as the poet describes them?</p>
<ol>
<li>in stanzas two and three?</li>
<li>in the last two lines of the poem?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is no difference between the two roads in stanzas two and three</li>
<li>In the last two lines of the poem the poet tells that the road he opted for is less travelled.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What do you think the last two lines of the poem mean? (Looking back, does the poet regret his choice or accept it?)<br />
Answer:<br />
The last two lines have the quintessence of the poem. The poet expresses his opinion that it becomes difficult for a normal human being to change his/her decision. The poet intends to walk on the first road but he couldn’t do so because life does not offer multiple chances to choose. The decision taken may mar one’s future or lead one to success. It makes all the differences. He now repents for not getting a chance to travel on the first road.</p>
<p><strong>II.</strong><br />
Question 1.<br />
Have you ever had to make a difficult choice (or do you think you will have difficult choices to make)? How will you make the choice (for what reasons)?<br />
Answer:<br />
Such situations occur in everyone’s life. In today’s world people have numerous alternatives. But the decision should be taken after considering all the ins and outs of the situation. We must ruminate over the disadvantages also.</p>
<p>Students can write their own experiences.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
After you have made a choice do you always think about what might have been, or do you accept the reality?<br />
Answer:.<br />
One should live in the present and not in the past. The philosophy of ‘is’ is the key to attaining success. Life is not a bed of roses. Its hurdles are to be crossed bravely. One must not feel nervous and get dejected in the trying circumstances. On some instances, one needs to be confident about the choice he/she makes.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Additional Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Short answer type questions</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What was the poet’s dilemma?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poet was standing before the two roads. He had to decide which one would lead him to success. It was not easy for him to decide. So he stood there and introspected. Out the two options, he had to choose the one. Of course, it was not an easy choice.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What was the poet’s opinion about both the roads?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poet opined that both the roads were same. They were equally travelled and there was no difference between them. So he got confused. It was difficult to decide which road would be more convenient and comfortable. He wanted to choose the one that would take him to his intended destination.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What do the roads represent?<br />
Answer:<br />
The roads represent the problem of decision-making. Human beings suffer because of their choices and decisions. They find themselves in such situations at every step in their lives. Out of the available options, they have to choose the one that may take them to their destination. The choice decides the outcome in life.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Did the poet take his decision haphazardly?<br />
Answer:<br />
No, he speculated and brooded over the situation. He took this decision after a lot of contemplation. He did not take this decision haphazardly. No doubt, he was a bit confused. After all, it was not quite easy to make the right choice. But he exercised his option after much contemplation.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Why did the poet choose that road?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poet chose that road because it was less travelled. He wanted to do those activities which had not been done by anyone earlier. The poet didn’t seem to be interested in choosing a much trodden path of life. Avoiding the popular rat-race, he opted for the option that broke fresh grounds.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What is the message of the poem?<br />
Answer:<br />
The message of the poem is to make people aware of their analytical skills. The poet wishes to say that choices should be made carefully and thoughtfully. One should behave responsibly because life does not offer multiple chances every now and then.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Did the poet make the right choice?<br />
Answer:<br />
It is not easy to say whether the poet made the right choice or not. He, himself couldn’t reach to any such conclusion. It is possible that he may repent for making such a choice. He avoided the popular and off-beaten path of life. He dared to choose the path which was less frequented used by the people. This bold decision might bring all the difference in his life.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Why did the poet take the ‘other’ road? Why did the ‘other’ road have a better claim than the first road?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poet had to choose one of the two roads. He left the one which was a popular choice. He decided to take the ‘other’ road which was less frequented and travelled by the people. The ‘other’ road had a better claim as it was grassy. It invited the people to walk on it.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Describe the conditions of both the roads that lay open before the poet on that morning.<br />
Answer:<br />
In the yellow autumnal wood, two roads diverged into two directions. Both of them were covered with the fallen leaves. In the morning, both of them were still untouched. The steps of travellers have not blackened them. One was frequently used by the travellers. The other one was not a popular choice. It seemed to invite people to walk on it.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Was the poet certain to come back on the road he had left for another day?<br />
Answer:<br />
Life and its ways are complex and confusing. One roads leads to another. In this web, one has to make a choice. The poet left the one road and hope that he would use it on another day. But he was quite doubtful. It often happens that the road that is left once, is left forever. Rarely do we come on to that road again.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
How does the outcome of our life depends on the choice we make to reach our destinations?<br />
Answer:<br />
Life is full of complexities. It provides us with different choices and options. The choice is never easy. Our success or failure depends on the choice that we make. Mostly people choose the most popular or frequented paths of life. But some bold and adventurous people take risks and choose the less frequented paths and ways of life.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer type questions</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
In the poem “The Road Not Taken,” what do the woods symbolize?<br />
Answer:<br />
In this poem, the poet comes to a fork in the road where it is diversified into paths, and he must decide which path to follow. Both paths run in different directions through a “yellow wood.” The poet finds himself standing in the middle and in dilemma of choosing the right path. The woods in this poem symbolize the difficulty of seeing into the future. The poet must make a choice based on limited information, since much of what he might like to see is not clear. The poet will have to rely on faith and intuition as he makes his choice, as we often must do in life. ‘Woods’ in the poem stand for the complexities of human life. Life is like a maze. The ‘forks’ stand for the ‘alternatives’ or ‘options’ life provides to reach the destination. What you reap later on in life, depends on the ‘options’ or the ‘ways’ you choose during the course of life.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
According to the poem, how does the poet feel about his or her decision in the end?<br />
Answer:<br />
The speaker of this poem is Robert Frost himself. He is thinking about a career decision he made many years ago. He had to make a choice between seeking a secure profession which would enable him to live in comfort or to devote him to poetry and live a simple life close to nature. Same like the poet, many of us don’t know whether to trust our instincts and go ahead with the pursuit of our dreams. Frost chose to devote his life to his poetry. The poet does not appear to regret the choice he made, but he sounds wistful in the last as if he wishes he knew what his alternate life would have been like if he had taken the other road.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What is the theme or the message of the poem ‘The Road Not Taken’?<br />
Answer:<br />
Robert Frost’s ‘The Road Not taken’ deals with the complexities of life. Life and its ways never woven in a straight line. Life provides many options. The web of life consists of many paths and sub-ways. Naturally, these complexities of life confuse a person. Out of many options and alternatives, he has to make a choice. Only a judicious choice make us reach our destination. Most of people choose the least risky and off-tradden ways of life. They don’t want to take any risk. Only a few persons like the poet dare to chose a different path of like. They are bold enough to face risks and challenges in life. One has to make a choice. His success or failure in life depends on his choice. The poet chose a different path. Popular fame and fortune are sacrificed in favour of art, literature and poetry. Nobody knows what he would have gained had he followed the least risky and safe path of life.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How does one way lead on to another? Is it easier to come back to the path we have left for another day?<br />
Answer:<br />
Every man has his own aim or the destination of life. Life provides many options and alternatives. The zig-zag way of life is always expanding. One way leads on to another. All these additions make the web of life quite complex. These pluralities of options confuse every man. He can’t follow all the ways or paths simultaneously. Amid this confusion, comes the problem of the right choice. The choice of the right or the wrong option makes all the difference in one’s life. One should make a judicious choice. Success or failure in life depends on the choice you make. If the choice is made, it is rather difficult to retrace our steps. Sometimes we leave one option or alternative with the hope of coming back to it on another day. It is quite possible that we may never come back to our original position again. Hence, we must make the right choice to get the desired result and success in life.</p>
<p><strong>Value based questions</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
How does bad decision affect one’s life?<br />
Answer:<br />
Life provides many ways, options and alternative. Pluralities of options confuse us. The outcome of life depends on the ways or path of life that we choose. We should always make the right or judicious choice. A wrong choice makes all the difference in life. It leads to unpleasant results and disastrous consequences. Bad decision affects one’s life badly. Actually our success depends on the decision which we take at present. If our decision is wrong, we have to repent for it because it ruins the countless happy moments of life. Our failure creates disappointment and we forget the essence of life. In a sense, it can be said that one bad decision spoils our life.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Describe the significance of good decisions. In what manner do they support life?<br />
Answer:<br />
The web of life is quite complex. Life provides many options. We can’t exercise all these options or alternatives. The choice has to be made. The choice we make will make all the difference in life. One road leads to another and it becomes difficult to come back to the original position. Only by following the right path of the life we can expect the desired results. Good decisions have a great deal of significance. They bring success, wealth and happiness in our life. A successful person has several friends and they support him/her in every possible manner. Besides, the common people take a very important lesson with regard to how decisions should be taken in life. Therefore, good decisions work as the source of inspiration for those who try to achieve success in life.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Short Answer Type Questions</strong><br />
<strong>(About 30-40 words each)</strong></p>
<p>Question 1:<strong><br />
</strong>Why will the choice between two roads that seem very much alike make such a big difference many years later in the life of the poet ?<br />
Answer:<br />
A choice between two roads that seem very much alike will make such a big difference many years later in the poet&#8217;s life&#8217;since this particular decision, this path opened up many different opportunities for him in future. The decision that he now makes will influence him and his life and his rest of the decisions since the two roads are same they still have varied options in them.</p>
<p>Question 2:<strong><br />
</strong>Does the speaker feel that he has made the wrong choice in taking the road &#8220;less travelled by&#8221;? If not, why does he &#8220;sigh&#8221;? What does he regret ?<br />
Answer:<br />
No, the speaker does not feel that he has made a wrong decision by taking the road less travelled. The poet wanted to explore both the roads. He tells himself that he will explore one and then come back and explore the other, but he knows that he will probably be unable to do so.</p>
<p>Question 3:<strong><br />
</strong>And that has made all the difference. What is your opinion of the difference- was it for the better or the worse? Substantiate your answer.<br />
Answer:<strong><br />
</strong> The poem does not clearly state whether the choice made by the poet made him happy or sad. However, if examined the way of the world, we find that the individuals who have achieved recognition and fame have always eschewed the beaten track. Hence, we can reason that the poet-poet-traveller was made happy by choosing the less travelled path, not the beaten track. The concluding line of the poem &#8220;And that has made all the difference&#8221; connotes the poet&#8217;s joy.</p>
<p>Question 4:<strong><br />
</strong>After reading the poem can you detail the tone entire poem.<br />
Answer:<br />
The overall tone of the poem is one of regret. He believes that at some time far in the future, he will still be thinking of his two possible paths &#8220;with a sigh&#8221;. He does not anticipate being any less conflicted then or any more satisfied with his choice. He realizes that his choice will have made &#8220;all the difference&#8221; in his life, but he is presently uncertain about what the difference will turn out to be.</p>
<p>Question 5:<strong><br />
</strong>Was the poet doubtful or clear that he would return to take the other path which he could not do earlier ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Throughout the poem and the poet&#8217;s journey he faces an archetypal dilemma. He doubts if he would ever be able to come back to take that other road which might have given him some other more lucrative options in life. The poet believes and we all know that one road leads to another so going back to the original path is not easy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Long Answer Type Questions (4 marks each)</strong><br />
<strong>(About 80-100 words each)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1:<br />
</strong>Does the poem, &#8216;The Road Not Taken&#8217;, symbolizes or reveals a meaning or aspect of freedom or responsibility ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poem reveals the complex nature of a seemingly simple decision. The narrator is conflicted as he thinks about which road to take. Even after some deliberation and the fact that usage &#8220;Had worn them really about the same,&#8221; he cannot help wondering, but then doubting &#8220;if I should ever come back&#8221;. He is even trying to convince himself that he has made the best choice as, when he looks back &#8220;Somewhere ages and ages hence&#8221;, he is sure that he will be able to say that he made the best choice and that it &#8220;has made all the difference&#8221;.<br />
This poem highlights the fact that freedom (of choice in this instance) brings with it its own set of responsibilities. Hie poem also, perhaps, indicates the futility of over-thinking some situations. If, even trivial decisions require so much thought, how can anyone ever make life-changing decisions. Apparently for the narrator, this is life-changing. At least the choice is his to make.</p>
<p>Question 2:<strong><br />
</strong>What do the two roads symbolize in the passage 1? What is the significance of choosing a road?<br />
Answer:<br />
The two roads that the poet-traveller faces in his walk or journey are symbolic of the choices that we have to encounter in our life. The journey or a simple walk itself is a metaphor for the great journey of life. In the poem the poet, after prolonged thought, decides to take the road less travelled, accepting its challenges and uncertainties. The decision is final and irreversible and it has its own consequences, may be positive or negative. In real life also we confront such critical situations where we face life-altering options. The decision we make is crucial. We should contemplate over the choices before and then decide our priorities. Once we make the decision and proceed accordingly, we can never reverse it. The life takes its own course, and it does not give a second chance to alter our decision and change our course of life. Hence, decide wisely.</p>
<p>Question 3:<strong><br />
</strong>What is the theme of the poem &#8220;The Road Not Taken&#8217; ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poem &#8216;The Road Not Taken&#8217; offers a profound perception into the process of decision making. The traveller at the crossroads of the diverging roads is symbolic of an individual at a decisive moment in his life&#8217;s journey. His decision or choice of future action is of utmost significance since the decision decides his destiny .The poet, Robert Frost, through this poem asserts the importance of the right decision at the right time. In life we have to make our choices; sometimes we have to make these choices without the full understanding of the state of affairs. Even then, we should arrive at decision only after carefully considering all the available options. We may regret our choice or we may be excited about our choice, but the choice at the crucial moment will determine and change the path of our life. Hence, the poem stresses the need for deep and critical analysis of the situation before we arrive at a life-transforming decision.</p>
<p>Question 4:<strong><br />
</strong>Discuss the anticipation or remorse in The Road Not Taken&#8217;.<br />
Answer:<br />
There is a fair amount of irony to be found here in the poem but this is also a poem infused with the anticipation of remorse. Its title is not &#8216;The Road Less Travelled&#8217; but &#8220;The Road Not Taken&#8221;. Even as he makes a choice (a choice he is forced to make if he does not want to stand forever in the woods, one for which he has no real guide or definitive basis for decision-making), the speaker knows that he will second-guess himself somewhere down the line— or at the very least he will wonder at what is irrevocably lost: the impossible, unknowable Other Path. But the nature of the decision is such that there is no Right Path— just the chosen path and the other path. The Road Less Travelled is a fiction the speaker will later invent, an attempt to polarize his past and give himself, retroactively, more agency than he really had. What are sighed for ages and ages hence are not so much the wrong decisions as the moments of decision themselves— moments that, one atop the other, mark the passing of a life. This is the more primal strain of remorse.</p>
<p>Question 5:<strong><br />
</strong>What appeals to you in the poem ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The poem, &#8220;The Road Not Taken&#8221; by Robert Frost is extremely appealing as it, in simple words and style, presents the importance of making judicious decision at critical moments in our life. In life we have to choose our options; sometimes we have to make these choices without a full awareness of the circumstances. Even then, we should come to a decision only after vigilantly considering all the offered alternatives. We may regret our choice or we may be thrilled of our choice, but the choice at the vital moment will determine and transform the path of our life. Hence, the poem emphasizes the necessity for deep and serious reasoning of the circumstances before we arrive at a life-transforming decision.</p>
