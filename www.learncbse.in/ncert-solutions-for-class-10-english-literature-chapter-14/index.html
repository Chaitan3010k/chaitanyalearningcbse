Answer:<br />
<strong>Possible reason for Assassination<br />
Mahatma Gandhi<br />
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Systematic brainwashing by the people who are staunch racists. As in the case of Gandhiji, hardcore Hindus were against him thinking him to be responsible for creating Pakistan, a separate country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indira Gandhi</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resistance against authority</li>
<li>Arranging the military attack on Harmandir Sahib during Operation Blue Star.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Abraham Lincoln</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Opposition to his legacy &#8211; abolition of slavery in the United States.</li>
<li>feeling of insecurity among supporters of slavery.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Political motives, i.e. enemies seeking revenge .</li>
<li>Deep-seated racial prejudice and jealousy</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rajiv Gandhi</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Feeling of insecurity among LTTE leaders.</li>
<li>To prevent him from coming to power and disarm LTTE.</li>
<li>Security lapses</li>
<li>Rajiv Gandhi was warned about the possibility of an attack and a threat to his life.</li>
<li>Meeting with LTTE delegation, made Rajiv complacent about his security.<br />
(students may form groups and discuss the above points in detail.)<br />
In my opinion, assassination is not the end to a problem. One must try to sort out the matter by the means of discussion and looking at the problem with a different outlook.<br />
Points for discussion in the context of present and past assassinations<br />
If we look at history, we will find the instances of a large number of politicians assassinated under different circumstances. These are ‘targeted killings’ undertaken for various reasons ranging from political and ideological differences, to attract media attention, etc. Earlier, there was a high demand to kill rulers who impose their rules on the population. In a country like India with many ethnicities and religions and differentTnte&#8217;rests, it is very difficult for a ruler or leader to satisfy their preferences and is more likely to attract attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes an assassination aims at creating chaos, irrespective of the leaders policies. The dominant position of the American President Kennedy, made him an attractive target.<br />
These political murders can be avoided by minimising political oppression.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Discuss in groups the reasons why the leaders you named in (2) were assassinated. Is assassination the end to a problem?<br />
Have a group discussion on the topic in the context of past/present day political assassinations.<br />

<p>Question 6.<br />
<strong>Answer the following questions briefly:<br />
</strong>(a) How do the heavens ‘blaze forth’ the death of Julius Caesar?<br />
Answer:<br />
It is said that when princes or kings die a star gets pulled from the sky. This star shoots and falls. This leaves behind a shining light. This happened on the day Caesar died.</p>
<p>(b) What does Calpurnia try to convince Caesar of?<br />
Answer:<br />
Calpurnia tries to convince Caesar not to go to senate house as nature is showing unusual signs. She fears that some untoward incident might happen with her husband.</p>
<p>(c) Why does Calpurnia say ‘Caesar’s wisdom is consumed in confidence’? What does she mean?<br />
Answer:<br />
Calpurnia tries to convince Caesar against going to Senate House by saying that his reasoning has been devoured by his overconfidence. That is why he is not able to take a right decision whether to go to Senate House or not.</p>
<p>(d) What does Calpurnia dream about Caesar? How does Decius Brutus interpret the dream?<br />
Answer:<br />
Calpurnia foresees in her dream the assassination of Julius Caesar. She sees in her dream Caesar’s body being transformed into a fountain from which his blood is spouting and Romans smilingly washing their hands in his blood. Brutus interprets that blood coming out of Caesars body shall enrich Rome. People shall soak their handkerchiefs in his blood and keep them as their prized possession fomgenerations to come.</p>
<p>(e) What are the arguments put forward by Decius Brutus to convince Caesar to go to the Capitol?<br />
Answer:<br />
Brutus says that Romans wanted to offer the crown to the mighty Caesar. If he did not go that day, they might change their minds. He also convinces him that the dream will prove to be auspicious.</p>
<p>(f) Why is Decius more successful than Calpurnia in persuading Caesar?<br />
Answer:<br />
Decius knew what Caesar wanted to hear. He knew that Caesar would easily be flattered by praise. So he used such a language which flattered him easily whereas Calpurnia was very fearful of her husbands wellbeing. So her language and tone did not match Caesars way of thinking. Caesar also thought that his wife was asking him to act as a coward.</p>
<p>(g) What is the petition put before Caesar by the conspirators? How does Caesar respond to it?<br />
Answer:<br />
The conspirators put a supplication before Caesar that he should free Publius Cimber from banishment. Caesar refuses to do so.</p>
<p>(h) Who says “Et tu Brute”? When are these words spoken? Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
These words were the last words of Julius Caesar when he was being stabbed by his own friends. These were spoken as his closest friend Brutus also stabbed him. Caesar could not believe that such a close friend could also backstab him.</p>
<p>(i) In the moments following Caesar’s death what do the conspirators proclaim to justify Caesar’s death?<br />
Answer:<br />
The conspirators proclaimed that Caesar was so ambitious that he would have enslaved all the Roman citizens.. Thus they killed Caesar to protect Rome and her people from him. Also that he would have become a tyrant.</p>
<p>(j) Seeing the body of Caesar, Antony is overcome by grief What does he say about Caesar?<br />
Answer:<br />
Antony is overwhelmed with grief on seeing Caesar’s body. He proclaims that in spite of his conquests, glories, triumphs and spoils, he lies so low. He offers to be killed and lie by Caesars side and he calls the conspirators as ‘choice’ and ‘master spirits’ of his age.</p>
<p>(k) Whom does Antony call “the choice and master spirits of this age”? Why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Antony calls Brutus and the others who have murdered Caesar as ‘the choice and master spirits of this age’ because they are the ones who take this decision to murder somebody as great as Caesar. He wants them to even kill him and lay him beside Caesar.</p>
<p>(l) How do Brutus and Cassius respond to Antony’s speech?<br />
Answer:<br />
Brutus asks Antony not to beg for his own death because they had killed Caesar with a purpose. They are not Antony’s enemies. He offers his arms of friendship to Antony and proclaims him to be their friend. Cassius says that with Antony by their side, he shall be strong like others and Antony’s words will carry much credibility as anybody else in the distribution of the new offices and honours.</p>
<p>(m) Why does Cassius object to allowing Antony to speak at Caesar’s funeral? How does Brutus overcome this objection?<br />
Answer:<br />
Cassius objects to allowing Antony to speak at Caesar’s funeral because he fears that Antony would move the people against them. Brutus overrules the objection saying that he himself would speak first and give a reason for Caesar’s murder. He will also tell people that Antony had been allowed to speak by his permission and that he should speak only after him.</p>
<p>(n) What are the conditions imposed by the conspirators before allowing Antony to speak at Caesar’s funeral?<br />
Answer:<br />
Conspirators agree to allow Antony to speak but Brutus will speak first giving reasons for killing Caesar. Antony could speak only after Brutus finishes and he must tell people that he had been given permission to speak by Cassius and Brutus. He would speak from the same pulpit as Brutus. Antony should not blame them for the killing of Julius Caesar.</p>
<p>(o) When he is left alone with the body of Caesar what does Antony call Brutus and the others?<br />
Answer:<br />
Antony begs pardon for he is being meek and gende with Caesar’s killers. He calls Caesar ‘a bleeding piece of earth’ and ‘ruins of the noblest man that ever lived in the tide of times’. He curses the hands that shed the cosdy blood of Caesar.</p>
<p>(p) What prediction does Antony make regarding the future events in Rome?<br />
Answer:<br />
Antony predicts that ‘domestic fury and fierce civil strife’ shall spread in Italy. Blood and destruction shall rage the country. Mothers shall go mad and smile when they’ll see their children slaughtered. The earth shall be covered with dead bodies lying for burial. Caesar’s spirit shall roam about for revenge and his spirit will be accompanied by Ate, the goddess of strife, who would come from hell.</p>
<p>(q) What reasons does Brutus give for murdering Caesar?<br />
Answer:<br />
Brutus says that he loved Caesar but loved Rome more. If Caesar had lived, he would have made all Romans slaves because he was ‘ambitious’. Would the people of Rome have liked that? They killed Caesar so that the people of Rome could be free. Brutus puts Caesar in wrong light saying that Caesar was ‘ambitious’. Therefore he had killed Caesar for the good of the country.</p>
<p>(r) Who says, “Let him be Caesar”? What light does this throw on the speaker?<br />
Answer:<br />
Third citizen says that. The speaker had deep respect and regard for the person spoken about. He idealises Caesar and wishes to give the same respectable position to Brutus.</p>
<p>(s) Why is Antony’s speech more effective?<br />
Answer:<br />
Antony’s speech is more effective because he knows what and how to speak. He articulates emotionally and tactfully to arouse emotions of the crowd so as to prepare them to take revenge.</p>
<p>(t) At the end of the scene what is the fate of Brutus and Cassius?<br />
Answer:<br />
Brutus and Cassius fall apart. They are defeated in a war with Antony and Octavius Caesar and later they commit suicide.</p>

<p>Question 9.<br />
Antony employs a number of devices to produce the desired effect on the mob. These devices maybe described as rhetorical devices. He first speaks in such a manner that it seems to the mob that he is in full agreement with Brutus about Caesar. Then step by step he moves away from Brutus’ position, depicting Brutus as a villain and Caesar as a wronged man.

<p>Question 10.<br />
Read the extracts given below and answer the questions that follow :</p>
<p>1. <strong>Caesar:</strong> Cowards die many times before their deaths ;<br />
The valiant never taste of death but once.<br />
Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.<br />
It seems to me most strange that men should fear ;<br />
Seeing that death, a necessary end,<br />
Will come when it will come.<br />
(a) Whom is Caesar speaking to? Why does he say these words?<br />
(b) What fears has the listener expressed?<br />
(c) What is the basis for the fears expressed?<br />

<p>Question 11.<br />
Stage a press conference that takes place shortly after Caesar’s death. The “reporters” should have their questions written down ahead of time to ask the students who play the roles of Brutus, Antony, and Cassius. These questions should focus on the key events in the play, as well as the characters’ intentions.<br />
Answer:<br />
<strong>Reporter (to Brutus):</strong> Caesar was your friend, still you killed him. Do you think you are right in doing this?<br />
<strong>Brutus:</strong> Yes, I don&#8217;t think I have done anything wrong. You can see only my deed but you don’t know the reason behind that. Caesar was overambitious and in Rome&#8217;s interest, it was necessary to kill him.<br />
<strong>Reporter</strong> (To Cassius) Do you have any comments to make on the conspiracy that you instigated? Can you justify your action?<br />
<strong>Cassius:</strong> Of course, we have our own honourable motives behind the conspiracy. Caesar was getting too ambitious to become a dictator. Morover he was not ready „ to free Publius Cimber.<br />
<strong>Reporter (to Antony)</strong> What do you have to say in this regard? Do you agree with what they say?<br />
<strong>Antony:</strong> I am top shocked to utter even a single word. The mighty Caesar is no more! My grief knows no bounds! To agree or not to agree with them is not a matter of concern. What matters to me more is why they have killed Caesar at all?<br />
<strong>Reporter (To Brutus):</strong> What is your real motive behind asking Antony to join you? Do you intend to hide your crime?<br />
<strong>Brutus:</strong> I have not committed any crime. I offer fo receive Antony out of love and respecf for him as he is a nice person.<br />
<strong>Reporter (To Antony)</strong> What is your attitude towards the offer that you have from Brutus?<br />
<strong>Antony:</strong> I am keen to know the reasons behind Caesar&#8217;s murder. Before accepting &#8211; their offer, I want to take Caesar&#8217;s body to the market place and speak at the funeral ceremony.<br />
Cassius disagrees but Brutus satisfies him by saying that he need not worry about that and the conference dispersed.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
<strong>Questions for Further Study:<br />
</strong>Given below are some questions based on reading of the play ‘Julius Caesar’. These questions are not for testing in the Exam. These are for a deeper understanding of the play and the characters.<br />

(g) Write a brief character sketch of Antony.<br />
(h) What is the role of Julius Caesar’s ghost in the play, Julius Caesar?<br />
(i) Why does Antony call Brutus ‘the noblest Roman of them all’?<br />
(j) How do Brutus and Cassius meet their end?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Decius Brutus and Cassius were jealous of Caesar’s growing popularity and thought Caesar was too ambitious to get the crown. In spite of being Caesars friend, Brutus joined the conspiracy with Cassius to bring democracy in Rome.<br />
(b) No, Caesar was not ambitious. He refused the crown that Mark Antony offered him after his victorious return.</p>
<p>(c) Cassius wanted to be powerful but Caesar’s growing power and the fear that Caesar might become a dictator one day, prompted him to instigate a conspiracy to murder Caesar.</p>
<p>(d) Brutus was the most trusted and respected in Rome and to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the Romans, it was necessary for the conspirators to win over the noble Brutus to their side.</p>
<p>(e) Brutus allowed Antony to speak at the funeral ceremony of Caesar. Though Cassius had warned him beforehand, he allowed Antony to speak and that led to the failure of the conspiracy.</p>
<p>(f) Caesar and Antony were great friends. Antony was Caesars most loyal friend. He was gready pained to see Caesar’s body lying on the ground and requested Cassius to kill him also as he could not bear separation from Caesar.</p>
<p>(g) Antony was a good orator and a loyal friend who, by the power of his geniuses, was able to reveal the reality of the conspirators before the general public. He was agonised deeply on losing his best friend, Caesar, and resolved to take revenge on the conspirators at all costs. He was just and determined.</p>
<p>(h) Antony prophesied that Caesar’s ghost would come with Ate, the Greek goddess of revenge, and would cry ‘Havoc’ in a voice suitable to a monarch. The foul deed of the murderers would come to the fore making them unable to bear the pain, they would groan for burial amidst all the chaos and confusion of war.</p>
<p>(i) Antony calls Brutus, ‘the noblest Roman of them all’ in a satirical manner. He wanted Romans to know the malicious motives of Brutus and avenge Caesar’s death.</p>
<p>(j) Antony was able to incite the mob against Brutus and Cassius very cleverly. They vowed to burn Caesar’s body in the holy place and with the brands fire the traitors’ houses. They met their end and Antony was able to avenge the death of Caesar.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
A reporter covers the event of the assassination of Julius Caesar in the senate giving graphic details and a catchy headline. Write the newspaper report in about 200 words.<br />
Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Mighty Caesar Falls</strong></p>
<p>I witnessed the brutal and cold-Blooded murder of Caesar by his great friend Brutus and other conspirators that included the honourable Cassius as well.</p>
<p>It came as a shock when Caesar was caught unawares and attacked by sword repeatedly by Cassius, Brutus and other conspirators. The blood of the bold and courageous general was there for all to see. Such a valiant general who brought laurels to Rome was brutally murdered. These men were jealous of his fame and popularity. Antony who loved Caesar took his body to the public place where all the people of Rome could see it.</p>
<p>Brutus was the first one to address the people. He justified the murder saying that Caesar had become too ambitious and that prompted them to take such a step. He said that he loved Caesar but loved his country more than Caesar. The people of Rome were convinced with what he said. Then came Antony who drew the attention of the people to the valiant Caesar and what all he had done for his country and countrymen. He told them that Caesar had bequeathed his will to the people of Rome. It is then that people understood the wrong done by the conspirators. They decided to avenge the killing of Caesar.</p>
