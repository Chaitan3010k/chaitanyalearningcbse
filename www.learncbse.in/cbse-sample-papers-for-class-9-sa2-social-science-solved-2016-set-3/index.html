<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>“In pre-colonial times, the Maasai society was divided into two social categories”. Explain.</strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>What is shifting agriculture ? Why was it discouraged by the Europeans ? Give reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) The urban population was growing and the export market was becoming bigger. As a result, demand for wheat went up which resulted into high price of wheat.<br />
(ii)The spread of railways made it easy to transport the grain from the wheat growing regions to the eastern coast for export.<br />
(iii)By the early 20th century, the demand for wheat rose even higher and during the First World War, the world market boomed.<br />
Or<br />
(i)The Maasai society was divided into elders and<br />
(ii)The elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes.<br />

Or<br />
It is a type of agriculture under which parts of forests are cut and burnt in rotation.<br />
(i)Shifting cultivation made it harder for the government to calculate taxes. Therefore, the government decided to ban shifting cultivation.<br />
(ii)European foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests. They felt that land which was used for cultivation every few years could not grow trees for railway timber.<br />
(iii)There was also the added danger of the flames spreading and burning valuable timber.</p>
<p><strong>10. “Cricket has changed with changing times and yet fundamentally remained true to its origin in rural England”. Justify by giving examples.   </strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>Explain the reasons for the changes in clothing patterns and materials in the 18th century.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) No specification for ground : Even after more than 300 years of its origin still there is no specification regarding the measurement of the playing ground.<br />
(ii)Equipments : Cricket&#8217;s most important tools are all made of natural, pre-industrial materials. The bat is made of wood as are the stumps and bails. The ball is made with leather, twine and Even today, both bat and ball are hand-made, not industrially manufactured. The material of the bat changed slightly over time. Once it was cut out of a single piece of wood. Now it consists of two pieces, the blade which is made out of the wood of the willow tree and the handle which is made out of cane</p>
<p><strong>11. The Justify by giving examples.</strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>Why women in the nineteenth century w ere obliged to continue wearing Indian</strong><br />
<strong>dress even when men switched over to the more convenient western clothing ?</strong><br />
<strong>What does this show about the position of women in society ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Even after Indian independence kick-started the disappearance of the British empire, the regulation of international cricket remained the business of the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC).<br />
(ii)The ICC, renamed the International Cricket Conference as late as 1965, was dominated by its founding members, England and Australia, which retained the right of veto over its proceedings.<br />
(iii)England and the other white commonwealth countries, Australia and New Zealand, continued to play Test cricket with South Africa, a racist state that practised a policy of racial segregation which, among other things, barred non-whites (who made-up the majority of South Africa&#8217;s population) from representing that country in Test matches.<br />
Or<br />
In the 19th century women all over the world were changing the patterns of clothes but this did not happen in India because :<br />
(i) Rigid Caste System : Though there were no formal Sumptuary laws as in Europe but India had its own strict social codes of food and dress. The caste system clearly defined what subordinate and dominant caste Hindu should wear, eat, etc. and these codes had the force of law. For example, in May 1822, the Shanar caste women were attacked by Nair caste women for wearing a cloth across their upper bodies.<br />
(ii) Interference of the Government: The dress codes in India were so fixed that many a time, government had to intervene. When Shanar women who were converted to Christianity tried to wear tailored blouses and clothes to cover themselves like the upper castes, complaints were filed in court and the Governor of Travancore was forced to issue a proclamation in 1829 ordering Shanar women ‘to abstain in future from covering the upper parts of the body! Government was once again forced to intervene in 1859 over the cloth issue and had to issue another proclamation permitting Shanar women, whether Christian or Hindu, to wear a jacket, or cover their upper bodies in any manner whatever, but not like the women of high caste.<br />
(iii) Change in the Occupation : Before the arrival of Britishers most of the people were farmers, traders and businessmen. But after the arrival of Britishers they entered into the service sector. So men changed their dress according to the needs of work. In the 19th century most of the Indian women were still confined to the four walls of their houses so they continued their traditional dresses. So it is clear from the above examples that the men switched over to the more convenient western clothing but the women continued their traditional dresses.<br />
This shows the lower position of the women in the society.</p>
<p><strong>12. Mention any three factors which influence the climate of India.  </strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) The Himalayan mountain chain: It protects the Indian subcontinent from cold winds of the Central Asia. It creates barrier against the South-West monsoon.<br />
(ii)Western disturbances: Western disturbances originate near the Mediterranean sea. These cause rainfall in the north-west.<br />
(iii) Low pressure region of Central Asia and Tibet : During summer, low pressure region is formed over the Middle-East countries, Central Asia and Tibet. This induces a burst of monsoon in our country.</p>
<p><strong>13. Distinguish between dry deciduous and moist deciduous vegetation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong><br />
<img class="" src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1520/24123004345_f216d8af1b_o.png" alt="cbse-sample-papers-for-class-9-sa2-social-science-solved-2016-set-3-3" width="784" height="229" /></p>
<p><strong>14.What is sex ratio ? Give two reasons responsible for an unfavourable sex ratio in India. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> The number of females per thousand of males is called the sex ratio.In 1901, the ratio was 1000 : 972, but it dropped to 1000 : 940 in 2011. Main causes of the change of ratio are :</p>
<p>(i) Low social, economic and political status of women.</p>
<p>(ii) Dowry system is also responsible for this.</p>
<p><strong>15. Explain any three powers and functions of the Parliament. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>. (i) <strong>Legislative Powers</strong> : The Parliament can make laws on all those subjects which have been given in the Union List and the Concurrent List. Under certain cases, it can also make laws on those subjects which have been given in the State List.</p>
<p>(ii)<strong> Control over Finance</strong> : The annual budget of the Central Government is passed by Parliament. Without Parliament&#8217;s approval, the government cannot impose any tax or incur any expenditure</p>
<p>(iii)<strong>Control over the Executive</strong> : The Parliament can seek information regarding administration. It can pass a resolution of No Confidence against the ministry and ask it to resign. Question Hours are also quite effective in keeping the government and its ministers under control.</p>
<p><strong>16.‘The Right to Freedom is actually a cluster of several rights.* Mention any three. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Freedom to live in any part of India : All citizens are free to live in any part of<br />
India but State can put restrictions keeping in mind the welfare of local people.</p>
<p>(ii) Freedom to practise any profession or occupation : All citizens have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business.</p>
<p>(iii)Right to Free Movement: Every citizen of India has been granted freedom to move throughout the Indian territory.</p>
<p><strong>17. How does our Election Law regulate campaigns ? </strong></p>

<p>(Any three points to be explained)</p>
<p><strong>18. What are the major reasons for poverty in India ? Mention any three points. </strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) <strong>Lack of industrialisation</strong> : India is very backward from the industrial point of view. Hardly 3 per cent of the total working population is engaged in the large-scale industry.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Over dependence on agriculture</strong>: Even after more than 60 years of independence more than 60 per cent of our total population still depends on agriculture for its livelihood. Due to shortage of inputs, our agriculture is backward.</p>
<p>(iii)<strong>Inflationary pressure</strong> : Upward trend in prices adversely affects the poor sections of the society.</p>
<p>(iv)<strong>Unemployment</strong> : Due to lack of job opportunities, more than 90 lakhs of our total working force is unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>19. What is Public Distribution System (PDS) ? What is its importance ? Mention any three.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>. Under the Public Distribution System (PDS) Government of India has opened more than 4.6 lakh ration shops all over the country to distribute foodgrains and other essential goods to the poor people at reasonable rates.</p>
<p>(i)It distributes foodgrains to poor people at reasonable rates.</p>
<p>(ii)It protects the people from high prices.</p>
<p>(iii)It discourages black marketing and hoarding.</p>
<p><strong>20. Define:   (i) Buffer stock (ii) Issue price (iii) Fair Price Shops</strong></p>
<p><strong> Ans. (i) Buffer stock</strong> : It is the stock of foodgrains procured by the government through Food Corporation of India. The main objective of buffer stock is to distribute foodgrains in deficit areas and among the poorer strata of the society.</p>
<p><strong>(ii)Issue price</strong> : It is the price at which government provides foodgrains to the poorer strata of the society through Public Distribution System.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Fair price shops</strong> : These are ration shops which have been opened by the government to provide foodgrains to the poorer strata of the society.</p>
<p><strong>21. How did the local people look after and protect the forests in Bastar region ? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explain why nomadic people need to move from one place to another ? What are the impacts of the environment of this continuous movement ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p><strong>What was enclosure system ? How were the poor affected by the enclosure movement ?</strong></p>
<p>Ans.The tribal people had formulated strict rules and regulations about how to manage and use the forests.</p>
<p>They believed that each village was given its land by the earth, and in return, they look after the earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival.</p>
<p>Some villages also protected their forests by engaging watchmen.</p>
<p>Every year, there was a meeting to discuss about the issues relating to environment and resources.</p>
<p>Local people looked after all the natural resources within their boundary.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Climatic condition : Climatic conditions are primarily responsible for the movement of the nomadic people. In winter, when the high mountains are covered with snow they move towards low hills and with the onset of summer, they start their backward journey. The arrival and departure of monsoon also decides their movement. For example, the Gollas of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh move towards the coastal tracts during the dry season, and leave when the rain comes.</p>
<p>Fodder : Fodder for the animals is another important factor which decides the movement of the nomads. The Gujjar Bakarwals migrate to low hills of the Shiwalik due to the availability of grazing grounds in the low hills.</p>
<p>Foodgrains : The availability of foodgrains in different regions is also an important factor which decides their migration. For example, the Dhangars get rice from Konkani peasants.</p>
<p>Impact on the environment of the continuous movement:</p>
<p>(i)The continuous movement allowed the pastures to recover and this prevents their overuse.</p>
<p>(ii)The flocks of nomads manured the field. So there is less use of chemical fertilizers.</p>
<p>Or</p>
<p>Under the enclosure system, the common land which was the property of the whole village was being enclosed by rich landlords. The common land was enclosed by building hedges around the land to separate it from that of others.</p>
<p>(i) When fences came up, the enclosed land became the exclusive property of one landowner. The poor could no longer collect their firewood from the forests, or graze their cattle on the commons.</p>
<p>(ii)They could no longer collect apples and berries, or hunt small animals for meat. Nor could they gather the stalks that lay on the fields after the crops were harvested.</p>
<p>(iii)In places, where enclosures happened on an extensive scale, particularly the Midlands and the countries around, the poor were displaced from the land. They found their customary rights gradually disappearing.</p>
<p>(iv)Deprived of their rights, and driven off the land, they tramped in search of work. From the Midlands, they moved to the southern countries of England. This was a region that was most intensively cultivated, and there was a great demand for agricultural labourers. But nowhere could the poor find secure jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Q.22. Hoe did Indians react to Western clothing ? Explain.</strong></p>
<p><strong>or</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8216;The  British used cricket to carry out their racial policy in the colonies’. Justify giving examples.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> (i) <strong>Incorporation of western style</strong> : Many, especially men, began incorporating some elements of Western-style clothing in their dress. The wealthy Par sis of Western India were among the first to adopt Western-style clothing. The Baggy trousers and the phenta (or hat) were added to long collarless coats, with boots and a walking stick to complete the look of the gentleman. To some, Western clothes were a sign of modernity and progress.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Dalits and Western Clothes</strong> : Western-style clothing was also especially attractive to groups of dalit converts to Christianity who now found it liberating. Here, too, they were men rather than women who affected the new dress styles.</p>
<p>(iii) <strong>Reaction of conservatives</strong> : There were many Indians who were against westernisation of clothes. The traditional Indians were convinced that western culture would lead to a loss of traditional cultural identity. According to orthodox people Western-style clothes were taken as a sign of the world turning upside down.</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Dress according to time</strong> : There were some Indians who resolved the dilemma by wearing both types of clothes. They started wearing western clothes without giving up their Indian dress. For example, many Bengali bureaucrats began stocking western- style clothes for work outside the home and changed into more comfortable Indian clothes at home. There were some who started combining western and Indian forms of dressing.</p>
<p><strong>(v) </strong>British rule and dress code: In different cultures, specific items of clothing often convey contrary meanings. The turban in India was not just for protection from the heat but was a sign of respectability, and could not be removed at will. Whereas the hat had to be removed before social superiors as a sign of respect.</p>
<p>or</p>
<ul>
<li>Playing cricket was considered a sign of superior social and racial status.</li>
<li>Afro-Caribbean clubs were discouraged from participating in organised cricket club.</li>
<li>The first non-white club in West Indies was established towards the end of 19th century and even in this case, its members were light skinned mulattos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Cricket in colonial India was also organised on the principle of race and</li>
<li>The colonial flavour of world cricket during the 1950s and the 1960s can be seen from the fact that England and the other white commonwealth countries, Australia and New Zealand, continued to play Test Cricket with South Africa, a racist state that practised a policy of racial segregation which, among other things, barred the non-whites (who made up the majority of South Africa’s population) from representing that country in Test matches.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>23. Describe the regional variations in the climatic condition of India with the help of suitable examples.    </strong></p>
<p><strong> Ans.</strong> (i) In summers, the temperature in Thar Desert is about 50°C, and it is about &#8211; 45°C at Dras in Jammu and Kashmir during winter.</p>
<p>(ii) The daily range of temperature in Andaman and Nicobar or Kerala desert is below 6° or 7°C but in the Thar Desert, it may be 50°C.</p>
<p>(iii) In the summers, the temperature at Barmer is about 50°C, and in Pahalgam, it is about 20°C.</p>
<p>(iv) In the winters, the temperature in Dras is about -45°C whereas in Thiruvananthapuram, it is about 20°C.</p>
<p>(v) The annual rainfall in Meghalaya is over 400 cm whereas in the Thar Desert, it is less than 10 cm.</p>
<p><strong>24. Why are forests very important to human beings and environment ? Explain. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> (i)<strong> Forest products</strong> : Forests provide us timber, fuelwood, hardwood, bamboos, drugs, spices, etc. These also provide us useful raw material for making paper.</p>
<p>(ii) <strong>Natural environment</strong>: Forests provide a natural environment for wildlife which is one of the biggest assets of India.</p>
<p>(iii)<strong> Ecological balance</strong> : Forests provide an ecological balance which is vital for the sustenance of all life forms &#8211; human beings, animals and plants.</p>
<p>(iv) <strong>Livelihood</strong> : Forests provide livelihood to many forest communities and tribes.</p>
<p>(v)<strong> Fertility of soil</strong>: Forests add large quantities of leaves, twigs and branches, which after decomposition, form humus. The humus increases the fertility of the soil and hence, increases crop production.</p>
<p><strong>25. What is an election? Explain any four conditions that make election democratic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> An election is a contest between different political parties in order to get people’s support.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>An independent Election Commission</strong> : In our country, elections are conducted by an independent and a very powerful Election Commission (EC). It enjoys the same kind of independence that the judiciary enjoys. The Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is appointed by the President of India. But once appointed, the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) is not answerable to the President or the government. Even if the ruling party or the government does not like what the Commission does, it is virtually impossible for it to remove the CEC.</li>
<li><strong>Popular Participation</strong> : In India, the poor, illiterate and underprivileged people vote in larger proportion as compared to the rich and the privileged sections. This is in contrast to western democracies. For example, in the United States of America, poor people, African Americans and Hispanics vote much less than the rich and the white people.</li>
<li><strong>Acceptance of election outcome</strong>: The outcome of India’s elections speaks for itself: The ruling parties routinely lose elections in India, both at the national and the state levels. In fact, in every two out of the three elections held in the last fifteen years, the ruling party lost. In the US, an incumbent or ‘sitting’ elected representative rarely loses an election. In India, about half of the sitting MPs or the MLAs lose elections.</li>
<li><strong>Regular elections</strong> : In India, the Lok Sabha and the Vidhan Sabha elections are held regularly after every five years. After five years, the term of all the elected representatives comes to an end.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>26. Explain the major powers and functions of the Prime Minister.    </strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> <strong>(i) Link</strong> : The Prime Minister is the link between the Cabinet and the President. The decisions of the Cabinet are conveyed to the President through the Prime Minister. It is he who keeps him informed on all matters of government.</p>
<p><strong>(ii) Formation of the Cabinet</strong>: The Prime Minister prepares the list of his Council of Ministers and sends it to the President. He can reshuffle his Council of Ministers whenever he likes. He can also ask any minister to resign if he is not satisfied by his working.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Leader of the Lok Sabha</strong> : The Prime Minister presides over the meetings of the Cabinet. He maintains coordination between different departments of the government.</p>
<p><strong>(iv) Foreign Affairs</strong> : The Prime Minister plays an important role in the management of foreign affairs. He formulates the internal and external policies of the country.</p>
<p><strong>(v) Leader of the Party</strong> : The Prime Minister has the main say in framing the policy of his party.</p>
