Here we have given CBSE Class 10 English Workbook Solutions Unit 12 Active and Passive.</p>
<h2>CBSE Class 10 English Workbook Solutions Unit 12 Active and Passive</h2>
<p><strong>A. Introduction</strong></p>
<p>A.1.<br />
Complete the following sentences using the correct form of the verbs given in brackets.</p>
<p>1. It is a big college. More than a hundred teachers __________ (employ) there.<br />
2. __________ (somebody/clean) the office yesterday ?<br />

5. The parcel __________ (send) a month ago and it __________ (arrive) only yesterday.<br />

<ul>
<li>Did you use the same type of construction in your answers? [No]</li>
<li>What are the two types of construction called?
<ul>
<li>__________</li>
<li>__________</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>

<li>are employed</li>
<li>Did somebody clean</li>
<li>is covered</li>
<li>are locked</li>
<li>was sent, arrived</li>
<li>were these photographs taken, Did you take</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li>Active</li>
<li>Passive</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A.2.<br />
When do we use the passive voice ?<br />
<strong>Example :</strong> Look at the following sentences :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(а) My grandfather established this steel factory in 1940.<br />
(b) This steel factory was established in 1940 by my grandfather.</p>
<p>We use the passive voice when we are more interested in the action than the person who does it or when we do not know the active subject.</p>
<p>Read the following sentences and using the given clues, find out the reason for the use of the passive construction as in the Example above.</p>
<p>1. He was killed in the World War II.<br />
Clue : Who must have killed him ? Is it obvious ?<br />
— The doer or subject of the action is not obvious or known.</p>
<p>2. The Bank was looted last night.<br />
Clue : Have the police caught the culprits ?<br />
— Reason : Active subject is not known. OR the action needs more emphasis.</p>
<p>3. Sachin Tendulkar is looked upon as a sporting icon.<br />
Clue : By whom ?<br />
— We are more interested in the action than who does it.</p>
<p>4. This sort of road-side restaurants can be seen everywhere in this city.<br />
Clue : How will you write it in active voice ?<br />
— One can see this sort of road-side restaurants anywhere in this city.<br />
The doer or subject is not important.</p>
<p>5. When he arrived at the airport, he was arrested.<br />
Clue : Rewrite the sentence in active voice. Is it a little awkward ?<br />
— The custom officers arrested him when he arrived at the airport. Yes. It is a little awkward.</p>
<p>6. Employer : On account of tight financial condition, bonus will not be paid this year.<br />
Clue : If it is some good news, what voice will the employer use ?<br />
—The subject or doer of the action is obvious.</p>
<p>7. I got my hair cut.<br />
Clue : Look at the construction using ‘got’.<br />
—The object or agent is obvious.</p>
<p>We must remember that all active constructions cannot/should not be transformed into passive constructions mechanically, even if such transformation is possible.</p>
<p>Example: (a) He is drinking water.<br />
(b) Water is being drunk by him</p>
<p>Though sentence (b) is grammatically correct, we do not write or speak such a sentence. It is unnatural. Hence it is necessary to keep in mind that the passive voice has certain legitimate uses as discussed in A.2.</p>
<p>A.3.<br />
Match the excerpts below with the text types given in the box.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpts</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The tea leaves are picked and left to dry in the sun.</li>
<li>20 ml of the salt is taken in a test tube and heated over the flame of a Bunsen burner.</li>
<li>Many villagers were adversely affected by the flash flood. It is estimated that nearly half of the standing crop has been submerged in water.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Text Types</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(a) Newspaper (and formal) report _______________<br />
(b) Description of processes _______________<br />
(c) Academic writings including reporting of scientific experiments _______________</p>
<p>What are the text types in which we can expect to find frequent use of the passive ?<br />
Answers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(a) → (3) Many villagers were adversely affected by the flash flood. It is estimated that nearly half of the standing crop has been submerged in water.<br />
(b) → (1) 20 ml of the salt is taken in a test tube and heated over the flame of Bunsen burner.<br />

Read the following excerpt from a news story and answer the questions given below the excerpt.<br />
<strong>74 killed in Myanmar quake.</strong></p>
<p>MAESAI (THAILAND). At least 74 people were killed in a strong earthquake that struck Myanmar, state media said on Friday, while a series of aftershocks have caused panic but only limited damage in Thailand and Laos.</p>
<p>The death toll from Thursday’s 6.8 magnitude tremor was expected to rise slightly in Myanmar after 225 homes and nine government buildings were destroyed. Over 100 people were injured, according to state television.</p>
<p>The quake sparked panic, but no major damage in other countries across southeast Asia has been reported. An aftershock of an estimated magnitude of 5.5 rattled Thailand on Friday but caused limited damage, although residents living in properties close to the epicentre were advised to leave their homes.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hindustan Times &#8211; March 26, 2011</p>
<p>1. Are all the verbs in the passage in passive voice ? What do you infer from this ?</p>
<p>No, all the verbs in passage are not in passive voice. Some are in the active voice. 1 infer from this that active voice is used when emphasis is on the subject. Passive voice is used when action is emphasised.</p>
<p>2. Underline the passive constructions in the passage and comment on why the passive is more appropriate than the active in these.<br />
The passive constructions to be underlined in the above extracts are :<br />
were killed<br />
was expected<br />
were destroyed<br />
were injured<br />
has been reported<br />
were advised</p>
<p>The passive is more appropriate than the active as the doer or subject of the action is obvious or understood. Secondly, in these sentences, the action or result is more important. Therefore, passive construction is used.</p>
<p>3. Rewrite the second paragraph, keeping all the verbs in active voice. Begin like this &#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Authorities expect the death toll from Thursday’s 6.8 magnitude tremor would rise slightly in Myanmar after the earthquake had destroyed 225 homes and nine government buildings. According to state television the earthquake injured 100people.</p>
<p>4. Does the re-written paragraph read well or is it a little awkward? Give reasons for your answer.</p>
<p>It is a little awkward. The reason is that the sentences don’t look natural due to repetition of the words ‘the earthquake’ which is not important.</p>

<p>New Delhi: 10 October (PTI) The interest of book lovers was marred when the stall of M/s Rendezvous Publishers at the World Book Fair at Pragati Maidan suddenly caught fire at about 10 am. There were over 2000 books being displayed. The fire spread in no time. There were many visitors in the stall. They got panicked due to smoke and sudden flames rising up. About 31 people were injured, including 11 women, 6 men and 14 children, in the sudden stampede caused by the panic. All the injured were taken to the nearby hospital. Four persons are still in the Intensive Care Unit. Fire Brigade was immediately called. But, strangely, water was not available nearby to extinguish the fire. The fire could be controlled only by noon. The cause  of the fire could not be established (known).</p>
