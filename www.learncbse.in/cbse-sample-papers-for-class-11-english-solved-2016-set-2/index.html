<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8)</strong><br />
Scientists have suggested that smoking may be a factor for developing psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia.<br />
The analysis by researchers from Kings College London, which was published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, found that people who suffer from psychosis are three times more likely to smoke than the rest.<br />
While this association is nothing new, little research has been conducted into whether smoking could actually be a causal factor for psychosis.<br />
Analysing data from 61 studies, comprising 15000 smokers and 273000 non-smokers, conducted around the world between 1980 and 2014, the team found that 57%.of people first diagnosed with psychosis were smokers. The researchers also found that daily smokers developed psychotic illness around a year earlier than non-smokers. It has long been hypothesised that higher smoking rates among psymhosis sufferers could be explained by people seeking relief from boredom or distress or self-medicating against the symptoms or side-effects of antipsychotic medication. But if this were so, researchers ww:M expect smoking rates to increase only after people had developed psychosis.<br />
However, the findings failed to prove its causation, with the researchers saying that some of the studies they looked at did not take into account possible confounding factors, such as whether smokers were also regular cannabis users, something psychotic illness is associated with. Researchers suggested a possible explanation for the link could be smoking’s impact on levels of the chemical dopamine in the brain, which also plays a role in psychotic illness.<br />
However, Dr James McCabe, clinical lecturer in psychosis studies at the King’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) said smoking should be “taken seriously as a possible risk factor” for psychosis and not “dismissed as a consequence of the illness”. Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at the IoPPN said, “Excess dopamine is the best biological explanation we have for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia. It is possible that nicotine exposure, by increasing the release of dopamine, causes psychosis to develop”.<br />

<p><strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.(12)</strong><br />
Travel is a bug that was in me when I was born, probably inherited from my father. In 24 years of travelling widely through India, I have been most fascinated by those little islands that dot the Bay of Bengal off the East Coast of India. Yes, I am talking about the Andaman Islands. Andamans somehow seemed almost sinister, with images of being haunted, bleak and scary, until my parents actually returned from a trip to Port Blair and told us about these serene islands. We immediately awaited the first opportunity to take a break and check them out. Finally, the D-Day came and we were all ready. We boarded the aircraft and to our surprise found that there were several empty seats. On enquiry, we learnt that all supplies to the Andamans including newspaper and meat go from the mainland and so there is always more cargo and less people.<br />
Port Blair airport is a small, old airport that was constructed in 1947. On my way to the hotel I noticed that there are none of the usual autorickshaws that noisily wend their way through most Indian towns. There was only one traffic signal in the entire town and the roads were more ups-and-downs than level. This was all surprising for a person like me who has lived in the coastal towns of Chennai and Mumbai.<br />
The colour of the sea was an unpolluted blue, a colour that I had not seen in any of the beaches in India. It was calm and beautiful. I was thrilled with the fact that we were going to spend 10 entire days there. All we had to do was sit in the open restaurant, look at the sea, enjoy the cool breeze and feel good.<br />
The Andaman Islands are a group of several islands, so most of our sightseeing was by boats. There are a total of more than 356 islands there. Even the oldest boatman, Rathnam, had seen only 200 of them. I figured that 10 days was surely not enough to get a full picture of this place, so I started to store every sight, every sound and every smell. The sound and light show at the jail sent a shiver down my spine. (This trip was before the movie ‘Kalapani’ was released). The realisation that those who fought for our Independence had lived, struggled, suffered and even died here left an impact.<br />

<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8)</strong><br />
Scientists have suggested that smoking may be a factor for developing psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia.<br />
The analysis by researchers from Kings College London, which was published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, found that people who suffer from psychosis are three times more likely to smoke than the rest.<br />
While this association is nothing new, little research has been conducted into whether smoking could actually be a causal factor for psychosis.<br />
Analysing data from 61 studies, comprising 15000 smokers and 273000 non-smokers, conducted around the world between 1980 and 2014, the team found that 57%.of people first diagnosed with psychosis were smokers. The researchers also found that daily smokers developed psychotic illness around a year earlier than non-smokers. It has long been hypothesised that higher smoking rates among psymhosis sufferers could be explained by people seeking relief from boredom or distress or self-medicating against the symptoms or side-effects of antipsychotic medication. But if this were so, researchers ww:M expect smoking rates to increase only after people had developed psychosis.<br />
However, the findings failed to prove its causation, with the researchers saying that some of the studies they looked at did not take into account possible confounding factors, such as whether smokers were also regular cannabis users, something psychotic illness is associated with. Researchers suggested a possible explanation for the link could be smoking’s impact on levels of the chemical dopamine in the brain, which also plays a role in psychotic illness.<br />
However, Dr James McCabe, clinical lecturer in psychosis studies at the King’s Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN) said smoking should be “taken seriously as a possible risk factor” for psychosis and not “dismissed as a consequence of the illness”. Sir Robin Murray, professor of psychiatric research at the IoPPN said, “Excess dopamine is the best biological explanation we have for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia. It is possible that nicotine exposure, by increasing the release of dopamine, causes psychosis to develop”.<br />

(b) <strong>Summary</strong><br />
Studies suggest that smoking causes psychotic illnesses like schizophrenia. Analysis from 61 studies, done on both smokers and non-smokers, concluded that 57% psychotic patients were smokers and daily smokers developed the disease earlier than others. Psychosis sufferers took to smoking for various reasons. However, findings failed to prove its causation. Researchers suggested the possible link could be smoking’s impact on levels of chemical dopamine, that plays a role in psychosis. Dr James McCabe suggested smoking as the possible risk factor and not to be dismissed as a consequence of the illness. Sir Robin Murray suggested excess dopamine release results in psychosis.<br />
<strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.(12)</strong><br />
Travel is a bug that was in me when I was born, probably inherited from my father. In 24 years of travelling widely through India, I have been most fascinated by those little islands that dot the Bay of Bengal off the East Coast of India. Yes, I am talking about the Andaman Islands. Andamans somehow seemed almost sinister, with images of being haunted, bleak and scary, until my parents actually returned from a trip to Port Blair and told us about these serene islands. We immediately awaited the first opportunity to take a break and check them out. Finally, the D-Day came and we were all ready. We boarded the aircraft and to our surprise found that there were several empty seats. On enquiry, we learnt that all supplies to the Andamans including newspaper and meat go from the mainland and so there is always more cargo and less people.<br />
Port Blair airport is a small, old airport that was constructed in 1947. On my way to the hotel I noticed that there are none of the usual autorickshaws that noisily wend their way through most Indian towns. There was only one traffic signal in the entire town and the roads were more ups-and-downs than level. This was all surprising for a person like me who has lived in the coastal towns of Chennai and Mumbai.<br />
The colour of the sea was an unpolluted blue, a colour that I had not seen in any of the beaches in India. It was calm and beautiful. I was thrilled with the fact that we were going to spend 10 entire days there. All we had to do was sit in the open restaurant, look at the sea, enjoy the cool breeze and feel good.<br />
The Andaman Islands are a group of several islands, so most of our sightseeing was by boats. There are a total of more than 356 islands there. Even the oldest boatman, Rathnam, had seen only 200 of them. I figured that 10 days was surely not enough to get a full picture of this place, so I started to store every sight, every sound and every smell. The sound and light show at the jail sent a shiver down my spine. (This trip was before the movie ‘Kalapani’ was released). The realisation that those who fought for our Independence had lived, struggled, suffered and even died here left an impact.<br />

<strong>Ans. </strong>                                <strong> Justice Delayed is Justice Denied</strong> <strong>by Seema</strong><br />
Daily we see that criminals are roaming scot free and their victims face a tough time psychologically and physically. This is only because justice is delayed. The delay is justice relates to the delay in actual deliverance of justice or passing of the final order by a judge.<br />
In India, we find that the working of the legal system is totally unsatisfactory. The number of cases in the courts is increasing day-by-day. The time taken on average is more than four years. Due to this delay, the culprits get time to turn the case to their advantage by illegal ways. They threaten the victim, harm eye witnesses etc. Eventually the victim loses courage to get justice.<br />
The system of law courts that we inherited from the British has grown outdated and needs change to suit current circumstances. Unless steps to ensure speedy disposal of cases are not taken, the justice system cannot give satisfactory results. The changes should aim at shortening the time period of the court proceedings modification in the rules and regulations and simplification of the procedures, so that people’s faith in the legal system can be restored.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Bizarre Accident at Metro Construction Site</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">by Supriya Tandon, Staff Correspondent</p>
<p><strong>New Delhi, 14th December, 20XX</strong> Something strange happened to the owner of the Honda City car; an accident that he would not have imagined even in his dreams. On a fine Monday morning he was on his way to office. While waiting at the signal of Dhaula Kuan, a brick fell from the overhead metro construction site and hit his car&#8217;s windscreen. The owner, Mahesh got shocked and couldn’t think of anything. He was numb as to what had happened. The glass broke immediately and spilled on the nearby bikers too. Mahesh escaped with little bruises on his face and fortunately no one else was hurt.<br />
He got out from the car and called the police. Meanwhile, the head engineer at the construction site had also come. The engineer took the responsibility for the accident and apologised for the same. But Mahesh was very angry, as he argued that it could have harmed him badly. He was determined to file a case against the construction company.<br />
The engineer, along with other officials, calmed him down. The engineer requested Mahesh not to take any serious action and also promised compensation from DMRC to settle the matter with mutual understanding.</p>

<strong>9.Read the extract carefully and answer the questions that follow by choosing the most appropriate option.(1&#215;3 = 3)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>“Where did my childhood go?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>It went to some forgotten place,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>That’s hidden in an infant’s face,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>That’s all I know.”    </strong></p>
<p><strong>(i) What belief does the poet hold in the above stanza?</strong><br />
<strong>(ii) The poet&#8217;s childhood has gone to&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</strong><br />
<strong>(iii) Why does he think that his childhood is &#8220;hidden in an infant&#8217;s face&#8221;?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) The poet believes that his childhood is hiding in the innocence of an infant.<br />
(ii) A forgotten place.<br />
(iii) He thinks that his childhood is hidden in an infant’s face because an infant is away from all the hypocrisy of the world.</p>
<p><strong>10. Answer any three of the following questions.   (3&#215;3 = 9)</strong><br />
<strong>(i) Based on the story, &#8220;We&#8217;re not Afraid to Die &#8230;. if We Can All Be Together&#8221;, explain how life teaches us lessons when we are face-to-face with death.</strong><br />
<strong>(ii) What did Ranga think about marriage?</strong><br />
<strong>(iii) In the story, Albert Einstein at School’, how is the difference shown</strong><br />
<strong>between information gathering and insight information?</strong><br />
<strong>(iv) Why did the narrator decide to forget the address?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Life teaches us lessons from our hazardous experiences when we are face-to-face with death.It teaches us not to lose hope under any circumstance. At times, life presents very grave situations but if one remains optimistic about finding a solution and overcomes the odds, one will always be successful.<br />
(ii) Ranga thought that he should marry a girl who is mature enough to understand him. He was searching for the right girl and did not want to marry a girl who is too young for his age. He decided to remain unmarried all his life if he didn’t find the right partner.<br />
(iii) In the story, the school education system is more concerned about information gathering rather than making students proficient in insight information. The teachers want students to t  learn dates and sequences mechanically. They do not encourage the observational and inferential skills of students that are essential to sharpen their intelligence<br />
(iv) The narrator did not want to remember the address—Number 46, Marconi street. She thought that the objects Mrs. Dorling had taken from their house had lost their value. They reminded her of a time which no longer existed. She tried to comfort herself by thinking that she had no space in her house to put those things.</p>
<p><strong>11. Answer the following questions in about 120-150 words.</strong><br />
<strong>What are the essential qualities of a teacher? Discuss with reference    to   the chapter, &#8216;The Browning Version’.  (6)</strong><br />
<strong> or</strong><br />
<strong> What values do we need to instil in us to avoid the problem of generation gap?</strong><br />
<strong> Express your views in context of the poem, &#8216;Father to Son&#8217;.   (6)</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> A teacher’s way of teaching reflects his character. We can judge from his teaching style what qualities he possesses.<br />
In the story, The Browning Version’, two teachers provide a striking contrast to each other. One is<br />
Mr. Frank who is a young schoolmaster who lacks commitment and involvement. He lacks honesty and doesn’t seem to care for the rules.<br />
Another is just opposite to Mr Frank, Mr Crocker-Harris, a middle-aged school master. .He is a ‘      strict man who is more feared than respected. He follows rules and regulations with all sincerity.<br />
He has a wonderful hold over his students. He is a hard taskmaster. He is unrelenting and punishes the children for their mistakes. In spite of all these limitations and weaknesses, students can’t help liking him. This shows that full dedication and honesty should be the foremost priority of a teacher</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Generation gap is a psychological and emotional gap between parents or elder people and the younger ones. This creates misunderstanding and lack of attachment between the parents and children. The success of parenting lies in how effectively parents avoid the generation gap or ignore differences with their children. Generation gap is the result of the fast paced development of society. In earlier times, two or three generations lived in the same lifestyle and environment as development was slow. Today, parents do not know many of the modern technologies and equipment children use.<br />
Children should help their parents understand these technologies and not treat them as backward. Remember, your parents taught you the little things of daily life.<br />
Parents also need to be co-operative and try to understand the point of view of the modern generation. When children express their feelings, understand them in the modern world context.</p>

<p><strong>12. Why did the ghost want to visit the twins as &#8220;The Headless Earl&#8221;?</strong><br />
<strong>(The Canterville Ghost) (6)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p><strong>Describe the experiment that General Armstrong wished to carry out at Hampton, (Up From Slavery) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Despite the non-interference of the ghost, the twins-the disrespectful young Etonians as they were called, after the name of the famous public school, Eton-did not spare the ghost. They intentionally stretched strings in the corridor over which the ghost accidentally tripped. He met a nasty fall on the butter slides that were built by the twins. The ghost felt very insulted. The twins had always fooled him. He therefore decided to make a final effort to give a solid blow to the twins. He wanted to assert his position by teaching the twins a lesson in the guise of ‘Headless Earl or Reckless Rupert’ Moreover, it had been one of his famous achievements that he would perform after seventy years as he had done before to frighten Lady Barbara Modish, who refused to marry Lord Canterville’s grandfather out of fear.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>General Armstrong wanted to experiment with the Red Indians by educating them at Hampton Institute and for this, Booker was selected as their teacher. He secured from the reservations in the Western states over one hundred Red Indians. The narrator was to be a sort of ‘house father’ to the students and was placed as an incharge of their discipline, clothing and rooms.<br />
He noticed that an average Red Indian felt himself above the white man and far above the blacks, because the blacks had submitted to slavery. But Booker soon won their love and respect. He found them like any other human being. They responded to kind treatment and resented ill-treatment. The most difficult was to convince them to get their hair cut, to give up wearing blankets and to cease smoking. Other than the difficulty of learning the English language, there was little difference between the coloured and the Indian students.</p>
<p><strong>13. How has Oscar Wilde given human characteristics to the ghost? Describe with reference to the novel. (The Canterville Ghost)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>Who were the &#8216;Ku KLux Klan&#8217; group? How did they pose a threat to the black people? (Up From Slavery)       (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Oscar Wiide has aptly presented the complexities of a human mind in portraying the character of the Canterville Ghost. On the second night of their moving into Canterville Chase, the Otises had an encounter with the ghost. At one O’clock at night, Mr Otis heard the clanking of metal and the sound of footsteps outside his room.<br />
Taking a bottle of lubricant, he opened the door to discover the ghost in soiled clothes and shackles on legs. He asked him to lubricate his chains and assured to supply more lubricant if needed. The ghosts’ eyes and queer appearance did not frighten Mr Otis.<br />
The ghost ran upstairs where the twins also added to the ghost’s confusion by throwing pillows at him. The ghost felt insulted at the unexpected behaviour and withdrew to his room to recollect his happy past days. He thought that no other ghost had been treated in such a manner as he was treated by the Otises.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">or</p>
<p>The Ku Klux Klan were bands of men who had joined together for the purpose of regulating the conduct of the coloured people, especially with the object of preventing the members of the race  from exercising any influence in politics. They corresponded somewhat to the ’patrollers’ who did the same during the period of slavery, but were dangerous and brutal. Like the ’patrollers’, the Ku Klux Klan operated mostly at night.<br />
Their objective was to crush the political aspirations of the Negroes, but did not confine themselves to this. Schools, houses as well as churches were burned by them and many innocent persons were made to suffer. During this period, many coloured people lost their lives. General Ruffner, the husband of Booker&#8217;s friend Mrs Viola Ruffner, was one of the white people injured when he tried to defend the coloured people during a confrontation. Booker saw this as the darkest period of the reconstruction days.</p>
