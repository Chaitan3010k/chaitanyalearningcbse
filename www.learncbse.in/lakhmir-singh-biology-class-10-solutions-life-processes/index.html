(c) What causes movement of food inside the alimentary canal ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Herbivores eat only plants so they need a longer small intestine to allow the cellulose present in the plants to be digested completely.<br />
(b) If mucus is not secreted, hydrochloric acid will cause the erosion of inner lining of stomach leading to the formation of ulcers in the stomach.<br />
(c) The contraction and expansion movements of oesophagus also called peristaltic movements pushes the food down into the elementary canal.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 60:</strong></span><br />
(a) How do guard cells regulate opening and closing of stomatal pores ?<br />
(b) Two similar green plants are kept separately in oxygen free containers, one in dark and the other in continuous light. Which one will live longer ? Give reasons.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The opening and closing of stomatal pores is controlled by the guard cells, when water flows into the guard cells, they swell, become curved and cause the pore to open whereas when the guard cells lose water, they shrink, become straight and close the stomatal pore. (b) Plant kept in continuous light will live longer because it will be able to produce oxygen required for its respiration by the process of photosynthesis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 61:</strong></span><br />
(a) What would happen if all the green plants disappear from the earth ?<br />
(b) If a plant is releasing carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen during the day, does it mean that there is no photosynthesis occurring ? Justify your answer.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) If all the green plants disappear from the earth, then all the organisms (herbivores, carnivores and omnivores) will die due to starvation as green plants are the source of food for all organisms.<br />
(b) When photosynthesis occurs during the day, the carbon dioxide released by plants by respiration is all used up and not released. Similarly, some of the oxygen produced during photosynthesis is used up in respiration. Since the plant is releasing carbon dioxide and taking in oxygen even during the day, it means that no photosynthesis is taking place.</p>

(b) Write a chemical equation to show the process of photosynthesis in plants.<br />
(c) Explain the mechanism of photosynthesis.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The process by which green plants make their own food (like glucose) from carbon dioxide and water by using sunlight energy in the presence of chlorophyll is called photosynthesis.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123931" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-3.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Life Processes 3" width="555" height="73" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-3.png 555w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-3-300x39.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 555px) 100vw, 555px" /><br />
(c) The process of photosynthesis takes place in the green leaves of a plant. The carbon dioxide gas required for making food is taken by the plant leaves from the air which enters the leaves through tiny pores called stomata. Water required for making food is taken from the soil which is transported to the leaves from the soil through the roots and the stem. The sunlight provides energy required to carry out the chemical reactions involved in the preparation of food. The green pigment called chlorophyll absorbs sunlight energy. The photosynthesis takes place in three steps:<br />
(i) Absorption of sunlight energy by chlorophyll.<br />
(ii) Conversion of light energy into chemical energy and splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen by light energy.<br />
(iii) Reduction of carbon dioxide by hydrogen to form carbohydrates like glucose by utilising the chemical energy.<br />

(a) Define nutrition. Why is nutrition necessary for an organism ?<br />
(b) What are the different modes of nutrition ? Explain with one example of each mode of nutrition.<br />
(c) Name the mode of nutrition in<br />
(i) roundworm, and<br />
(ii) Plasmodium.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Nutrition is defined as a process of intake of nutrients (like carbohydrates, fats, proteins, minerals, vitamins and water) by an organism as well as the utilisation of these nutrients by the organism. Nutrition is necessary for an organism as it provides energy to them from the food they eat. (b) There are mainly two modes of nutrition:<br />
(i) Autotrophic &#8211; Autotrophic nutrition is that mode of nutrition in which an organism makes its own food from the simple inorganic materials like carbon dioxide and water present in the surroundings (with the help of sunlight energy). Example: Green plants obtain food by autotrophic nutrition.<br />
(ii) Heterotrophic &#8211; Heterotrophic nutrition is that mode of nutrition in which an organism cannot make its own food from simple inorganic materials like carbon dioxide and water, and depends on other organisms for its food. Example: All animals obtain food by heterotrophic nutrition.<br />
(c) The mode of nutrition in<br />
(i) round worm and<br />
(ii) plasmodium is parasitic nutrition.</p>

(a) Describe the process of nutrition in Draw labelled diagrams to show the various steps in the nutrition in Amoeba.<br />
(b) What is the mode of nutrition in Amoeba known as ?<br />
(c) What is the process of obtaining food by Amoeba called ? What does it mean ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Nutrition in amoeba: Nutrition in amoeba involves the following steps<br />
(i) Ingestion ? Amoeba has no mouth for ingestion of food. It ingests the food by using its pseudopodia. The food is engulfed with little water to form a food vacuole.<br />
(ii) Digestion ? The food is digested by digestive enzymes present in the cytoplasm which breaks the food into small soluble molecules by chemical reactions.<br />
(iii) Absorption ? The digested food is absorbed directly into the cytoplasm by diffusion. The digested food spreads out from the food vacuole into the whole cell and after absorption the food vacuole disappears.<br />
(iv) Assimilation ? Food is used to obtain energy through respiration and the remaining part of the food is used for growth.<br />
(v) Egestion ? The undigested food collects inside the cell and the cell membrane ruptures. Through this, the undigested food is thrown out of the body.<br />

(b) Describe one way in which the small intestine is adapted for the absorption of digested food.<br />
(c) What is the special name of the contraction and expansion movement which pushes the food further in our digestive tract (or alimentary canal) ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Digestion of food in human beings: Digestion of food begins in the mouth. The mouth cavity contains teeth, tongue and salivary glands. The teeth cut the food into small pieces, chew and grind it. This is called physical digestion. Salivary glands produce saliva which mixes with the food. This involves chemical digestion of food. The saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase which digests the starch and converts it into maltose sugar. Mouth opens into a small funnel shaped area called pharynx which leads to a long tube called oesophagus. It carries the food down into the stomach. The wall of oesophagus is muscular. When the slightly digested food enters the food pipe, the walls of the oesophagus starts contraction and expansion movements called peristaltic movements which push the food into the stomach. Digestion does not take place in the oesophagus. The glands present on the walls of the stomach secrete gastric juice that contains hydrochloric acid, the enzyme pepsin and mucus. A small amount of gastric lipase is also present that breaks down the fats present in the food. Gastric juice is acidic due to the presence of HCl which is necessary for the pepsin to become active and converts the proteins into peptones. The mucus protects the stomach walls from HCl. From the stomach, the partially digested food goes into the small intestine through sphincter muscle. Small intestine is divided into two parts: Duodenum and Ileum. Duodenum receives the secretions of two glands, liver and pancreas through a common duct. Liver secretes bile which is alkaline and contains salts to emulsify the fats (or lipids). The bile secreted by the liver is stored in the gall bladder. Pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains trypsin, lipase and pancreatic amylase. Trypsin digests the proteins, lipase emulsifies the fats and pancreatic amylase breaks down the starch. Thus, small intestine is the site of complete digestion of carbohydrates, proteins and fats. The walls of ileum secrete succus entericus which completes the digestion process.<br />

<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 69:</strong></span><br />
(a) Describe the parts of our tooth with the help of a labelled diagram.<br />
(b) What is meant by dental caries ? How are they caused ?<br />
(c) What is dental plaque ? What harm can it do ? How can the formation of plaque be prevented ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The tooth has hard outer covering called enamel. The part of tooth below enamel is called dentine inside which is the pulp cavity. The pulp cavity contains nerves and blood vessels.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123936" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-8.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Life Processes 8" width="421" height="315" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-8.png 421w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-8-300x224.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 421px) 100vw, 421px" /><br />
(b) The formation of small cavities (or holes) in the teeth due to the action of acid forming bacteria and improper dental care is called dental caries. This happens as follows: When we eat sugary food, the bacteria in our mouth act on sugar to produce acids. These acids dissolve the calcium salts from the tooth enamel and then from dentine forming small cavities in the tooth over a period of time in our mouth act on sugar to produce acids. These acids dissolve the calcium salts from the tooth enamel and then from dentine forming small cavities in the tooth over a period of time.<br />
(c) If the teeth are not cleaned regularly, they become covered with the sticky, yellowish layer of food particles and bacteria cells called dental plaque. It causes tooth decay. It can be prevented by brushing the teeth regularly as it neutralises the acids.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 70:</strong></span><br />
(a) Name the main organs of the human digestive system. Also name the associated glands.<br />
(b) How do carbohydrates, fats and proteins get digested in human beings ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) The various organs of the human digestive system are mouth, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine and large intestine. The glands associated with the human digestive system are salivary glands, liver and pancreas.<br />
(b) (i) Carbohydrates &#8211; The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The human saliva contains an enzyme called salivary amylase which digests the starch present in the food into maltose sugar. The slightly digested carbohydrates when reaches the small intestine, pancreatic amylase present in the pancreatic juice breaks down the starch. The intestinal juice of the small intestine completes the digestion of carbohydrates and finally coverts it into glucose.<br />
(ii) Fats &#8211; The process of digestion of fats begins in the stomach. The glands of stomach secrete a small amount of gastric lipase that breaks down the fats present in the food. From the stomach the partially digested food goes into small intestine where the pancreatic lipase breaks down the emulsified fats. The walls of small intestine secrete intestinal juice which converts the fats into fatty acids and glycerol.<br />
(iii) Proteins &#8211; The digestion of proteins begins in the stomach. The glands of the stomach secrete gastric juice which contains an enzyme called pepsin. Pepsin converts the proteins into peptones. Pancreatic juice contains trypsin which digests the proteins into peptides and the intestinal juice completes the process of digestion of proteins thus converting it into amino acids.</p>

</strong></span>Explain why, when air is taken in and let out during breathing, the lungs always contain a residual volume of air.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
During the breathing cycle, when air is taken in and let out, the lungs always contain a certain residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time &#8216;for the oxygen absorbed&#8217; into the blood and &#8216;for the carbon dioxide to be released&#8217; from the blood.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 35:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, it is dangerous to inhale air containing carbon monoxide.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
It is dangerous to inhale air containing carbon monoxide as it binds very strongly with haemoglobin in the blood and prevents it from carrying oxygen to the brain and other parts of the body. Due to lack of oxygen, the person cannot breathe properly and may become unconscious or may even die.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 36:</strong></span><br />
Describe the process of respiration in State whether it is anaerobic respiration or aerobic respiration.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Respiration in amoeba: Amoeba depends on simple diffusion of gases for breathing. The diffusion of gases takes place through the thin cell membrane of amoeba. Amoeba lives in water which contains dissolved oxygen. The oxygen from water diffuses into the body of amoeba through its cell membrane. The oxygen spreads quickly into the whole body and is used for respiration inside the amoeba cell. The process of respiration produces carbon dioxide which diffuses out through its cell membrane into the surrounding water.<br />

<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 38:</strong></span><br />
Describe the process of respiration in fish.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
Respiration and fish: The fish has special organ of breathing called gills on both the sides of its head. The gills are covered by gill covers. The fish lives in water which contains dissolved oxygen. The fish breathes by taking in water through its mouth and sending it over the gills. When water passes over the gills, the gills extract dissolved oxygen from the water. The extracted oxygen is absorbed by the blood and carried to all the parts of the fish. The carbon dioxide produced by respiration is brought back by the blood into the gills for expelling into the surrounding water.<br />

<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 39:</strong></span><br />
What would be the consequences of deficiency of haemoglobin in our bodies ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
The deficiency of haemoglobin in the blood of a person reduces the oxygen carrying capacity of blood resulting in breathing problems, tiredness and lack of energy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 40:</strong></span><br />
Describe the process of respiration in the following parts of a plant :<br />
(a) Root<br />
(b) Stem<br />
(c) Leaves<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Respiration in roots: The roots of a plant take the oxygen required for respiration from the air present in-between the soil particles by the process of diffusion. The roots have extensions of epidermal cells of a root called root hair which are in contact with the air in the soil. Oxygen diffuses from root hairs and reaches all the other cells of the root for respiration. Carbon dioxide gas produced in the cells of the root during respiration moves out through the root hairs by the process of diffusion. Thus, the respiration in roots occurs by diffusion of respiratory gases through the root hairs.<br />
(b) Respiration in stems: The stems of herbaceous plants takes place through stomata. The oxygen from the air diffuses into the stem of a herbaceous plant through stomata and reaches all the cells for respiration. The carbon dioxide produced diffuses out through stomata. In woody stems, the bark has lenticels for the exchange of gases.<br />
(c) Respiration in leaves: The leaves of a plant has tiny pores called stomata through which the exchange of respiratory gases takes place by diffusion. Oxygen from air diffuses into a leaf through stomata and reaches all the cells, where it is used for respiration and the carbon dioxide produced diffuses out from the leaf into the air through stomata.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 41:</strong></span><br />
(a) What is meant by aquatic animals and terrestrial animals ?<br />
(b) From where do the aquatic animals and terrestrial animals obtain oxygen for breathing and respiration ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Aquatic animals are the animals which live in water and the terrestrial animals are the animals which live on land.<br />
(b) The aquatic animals use the oxygen dissolved in water to carry out respiration. The terrestrial animals obtain oxygen from air.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 42:</strong></span><br />
Why do fishes die when taken out of water ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
Fishes die when taken out of water because they do not have lungs to utilize the oxygen of air for breathing and respiration. They have gills which can extract only dissolved oxygen from water.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 43:</strong></span><br />
Why is the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms much faster than in terrestrial organisms ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
The rate of breathing in aquatic animals is much faster than terrestrial animals because the amount of oxygen dissolved in water is low as compared to the amount of oxygen dissolved in air.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 44:</strong></span><br />
Name the energy currency in the living organisms. When and where is it produced ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
The energy currency of the cell is &#8216;ATP&#8217;. It is produced in cytoplasm in lower organisms which respire anaerobically. In higher organisms, &#8216;ATP&#8217; is produced in mitochondria when they respire aerobically.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 45:</strong></span><br />
Explain why, plants have low energy needs as compared to animals.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
Plants do not move. In a large plant body there are many dead cells like sclerenchyma as a result it requires less energy as compared to animals.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 46:</strong></span><br />
Explain how, it would benefit deep sea divers if humans also had gills.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
If humans also had gills then the deep sea divers could remain under sea water even without carrying oxygen cylinders for breathing as they would be able to extract the dissolved oxygen from water for breathing purpose just like a fish does.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 47:</strong></span><br />

(b) The major organs of respiratory system in human beings are:<br />
(i) Nose<br />
(ii) Nasal Passage<br />
(iii) Trachea<br />
(iv) Bronchi<br />

(vi) diaphragm.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123939" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-11.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Life Processes 11" width="427" height="374" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-11.png 427w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-11-300x263.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 427px) 100vw, 427px" /></p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 48:</strong></span><br />
(a) Explain how, the air we breathe in gets cleaned while passing through the nasal passage.<br />
(b) Why do the walls of trachea not collapse when there is less air in it ?<br />
(c) How are oxygen and carbon dioxide exchanged in our body during respiration ?<br />
(d) How are lungs designed in human beings to maximise the exchange of gases ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) When air passes through the nasal passage, the dust particles and other impurities present in it are trapped by nasal hair and mucus so that clean air goes into the lungs.<br />
(b) Trachea does not collapse even when there is no air in it because it is supported by rings of soft bones called cartilage.<br />
(c) During the process of &#8216;breathing in&#8217; the air sacs or alveoli of the lungs get filled with air containing oxygen. The alveoli are surrounded by capillaries carrying blood so the oxygen of air diffuses from the alveoli walls into the blood from where it is carried to all the parts of the body.As the blood passes through the tissues of the body, the oxygen present in it diffuses into the cells. This oxygen combines with the digested food to release energy. Carbon dioxide gas is produced as a waste product during respiration in the cells of the body tissues which diffuses into the blood. Blood carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs where it diffuses into the alveoli.<br />
(d) The human lungs have been designed to maximise the exchange of gases as there are millions of alveoli in the lungs which provides a large surface area for the exchange of gases.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 49:</strong></span><br />
(a) Give the main points of difference between respiration in plants and respiration in animals.<br />
(b) Describe the exchange of gases which takes place in the leaves of a plant (a) during daytime, and (b) at night.<br />
(c) Which contains more carbon dixoide : exhaled air or inhaled air ? Why ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :<br />
</strong></span>(a)<br />
Respiration in plants<br />
(i) All the parts of the plants perform respiration individually.<br />
(ii) During respiration in plants there is a little transport of respiratory gases from one part of the plant to the other.<br />
(iii) The respiration in plants occurs at a slow rate.<br />
Respiration in Animals<br />
(i) An animal perfomrs respiration as a single unit.<br />
(ii) Respiratory gases are usually transported over long distances inside an animal during respiration.<br />
(iii) The respiration in animals occurs at a much faster rate.<br />
(b)<br />
(i) During daytime when photosynthesis occurs, oxygen is produced. The leaves use some of this oxygen for respiration and the rest of oxygen diffuses out into the air. Carbon dioxide produced by respiration is all used up in photosynthesis by leaves during the daytime. Even more carbon dioxide is taken in from air. Thus, the net gas exchange in leaves during daytime is: Oxygen diffuses out; Carbon dioxide diffuses in.<br />
(ii) At night time, when no photosynthesis occurs and hence no oxygen is produced, oxygen from air diffuses in leaves to carry out respiration. Carbon dioxide produced by respiration diffuses out into air. So, the net gas exchange in leaves at night is: Oxygen diffuses in; Carbon dioxide diffuses out.<br />
(c) Exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide because during the respiration process when oxygen breaks down glucose, then a lot of carbon dioxide is produced hence the exhaled air has a higher proportion of the same.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 50:</strong></span><br />

(c) What type of repiration takes place (i) in yeast, and (ii) in humans ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Respiration is a vital function of the body as it provides energy for carrying out all the life processes which are necessary to keep the organism alive.<br />
(b)<br />
Aerobic respiration<br />
(i) Aerobic respiration takes place in the presence of oxygen.<br />
(ii) Complete breakdown of food occurs in aerobic respiration.<br />
(iii) The end products in aerobic respiration are carbon dioxide and water.<br />
(iv) Aerobic respiration produces a considerable amount of energy.<br />
Example: Human Beings.<br />
Anaerobic respiration<br />
(i) Anaerobic respiration takes place in the absence of oxygen.<br />
(ii) Partial breakdown of food occurs in anaerobic respiration.<br />
(iii) The end products in anaerobic respiration are ethanol and carbon dioxide (in yeast) and lactic acid (in animal muscles).<br />
(iv) Much less energy is produced in anaerobic respiration. Example: Yeast.<br />
(c)<br />
(i) Anaerobic respiration.<br />
(ii) Aerobic respiration.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 51:</strong></span><br />
(a) Why is diffusion insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of large multicellular organisms like humans ?<br />
(b) What type of arrangement exists in the bodies of large animals to meet their oxygen requirements adequately ?<br />
(c) What advantage a terrestrial animal has over an aquatic animal with regard to obtaining oxygen for respiration ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Diffusion is insufficient to meet the oxygen requirements of large multicellular organisms like humans because the volume of human body is so big that the oxygen cannot diffuse into all the cells of the human body quickly and oxygen will have to travel large distances to reach each and every cell of the body.<br />
(b) Large organisms contain a respiratory pigment called haemoglobin which carries the oxygen from the lungs to all the body cells very efficiently.<br />
(c) A terrestrial animal has an advantage over an aquatic animal in regard to obtaining oxygen for respiration that it is surrounded by an oxygen rich atmosphere from where it can take any amount of oxygen.</p>

<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 52:</strong></span><br />
Describe the working of human blood circulatory system with the help of a suitable diagram which shows all the steps involved.<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
Working of Human blood circulatory system takes place in the steps below:<br />
(i) When the muscles of all the four chambers are relaxed, the pulmonary vein brings the oxygenated blood from the lungs in the left atrium of the heart.<br />
(ii) When the left atrium contracts, the oxygenated blood is pushed into the left ventricle through valve V<sub>1</sub>.<br />
(iii) When the left ventricle contracts, the oxygenated blood enters the main artery called aorta from which it goes to the different body organs through small branches called arterioles and capillaries. (iv) The main artery carries the blood to all the organs of the body head, arms etc except the lungs. The oxygenated blood gives off oxygen, digested food and dissolved materials to the body cells. The carbon dioxide produced in the cells enters the blood. The deoxygenated blood enters main vein called vena cava which carried it to the right atrium of the heart.<br />
(v) When the right atrium contracts, the deoxygenated blood enters right ventricle through valve V<sub>2</sub>.<br />
(vi) When the right ventricle contracts, the deoxygenated blood enters the lungs through pulmonary artery and releases carbon dioxide and absorbs fresh oxygen from air. The blood becomes oxygenated again and is sent to the left atrium of heart by pulmonary vein for circulation in the body. This whole process is repeated continuously.<br />

(c) Name the main nitrogenous waste in the human blood. How is it removed from the blood ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Lymphatic system: A system of tiny tubes called lymph vessels (lymphatics) and lymph nodes (lymph glands) in the human body which transports the liquid called lymph from the body tissues to the blood circulatory system is called lymphatic system. Functions of lymphatic system:<br />
(i) It takes part in the nutritive process of the body.<br />
(ii) It protects the body by killing the germs drained out of the body tissues with the help of lymphocytes contained in the lymph nodes, by making antibodies.<br />
(iii) It helps in removing the waste products like fragments of dead cells etc.<br />
(b) Blood pressure: The pressure at which the blood is pumped around the body by the heart is called blood pressure. The two factors which expresses the blood pressure a person are systolic pressure and diastolic pressure.<br />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-123947" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-19.png" alt="Lakhmir Singh Biology Class 10 Solutions Life Processes 19" width="353" height="335" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-19.png 353w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Lakhmir-Singh-Biology-Class-10-Solutions-Life-Processes-19-300x285.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 353px) 100vw, 353px" /><br />
(c) The excretory system removes the poisonous waste substances from the body in the form of urine and maintains ionic balance called osmoregulation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 56:</strong></span><br />
(a) Describe the mechanism of urine formation in human excretory system. Draw a labelled diagram to illustrate your answer.<br />
(b) Where is urine carried through ureters ?<br />
(c) What is urethra ?<br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Urine formation: The dirty blood containing waste like urea enters the glomerulus which filters the blood. During filtration, the substance like glucose, amino acids, salts, water, urea etc present in the blood pass into Bowman&#8217;s capsule and then enter the tubule of nephron. When the filtrate containing useful substances as well as the waste substances passes through the tubule, the useful substances like glucose, amino acids, most salts and water are reabsorbed into the blood through blood capillaries surrounding the tubule. Only the waste substances like urea, some unwanted salts and excess water remains behind in the tubule. This yellowish liquid is called urine.<br />

<p><span style="color: #000000;"><span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Question 58:</strong></span></span><br />
(a) Why is transport of materials necessary in an organism (plant or animal) ?<br />
(b) What is the need of special tissues or organs for transport of substances in plants and animals ?<br />
(c) How are water and minerals transported in plants ?<br />
(d) How is food transported in plants ?<span style="color: #000000;"><br />
<span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Solution :</strong></span><br />
(a) Transport in organisms (plants and animals) is necessary as it absorbs all essential substances and transports them to all parts so that they reach each and every cell of the body.<br />
(b) Special tissues and organs are needed for the transport of substances in plants and animals because these tissues and organs can pick up the essential substances like food, oxygen, water, etc at one end of their body and carry them to all other parts.<br />
(c) Water and minerals are transported to various parts of the plant by xylem tissues called xylem vessels and tracheids. Plants take in water from the soil through the roots. The water containing minerals called cell sap is carried by the xylem vessels to all the parts of the body. The roots have root hairs to absorb water and minerals from the soil by diffusion and then pass from cell to cell by osmosis through epidermis, root cortex, endodermis and then reach the root xylem. The water enters the root xylem into the stem xylem and then reaches the leaves from the petioles.<strong><strong><strong><br />

</strong></strong></strong>(d) Transportation of food in plants: The transport of food from the leaves to other parts of the plant is called translocation. Phloem tissue transports the food from the leaves to the other parts of the plant. The movement of food in phloem takes place by utilising energy. The sugar made in the leaves is loaded into the sieve tubes of phloem by using ATP. Water enters the sieve tube containing sugar which causes high pressure and pushes the food to all the parts of the plant having low pressure. This is how the food is transported according to the needs of the plant.</span></p>
