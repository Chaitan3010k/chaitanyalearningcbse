<p><strong>                                                                   SECTION A-Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">1.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Mt Everest has continued to attract climbers ever since June 8, 1924, when two members of a British expedition, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, had first attempted to climb the summit. The two men were last spotted &#8216;going strong&#8217; for the top, until the clouds perpetually swirling around Everest, engulfed them. They then vanished.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Mallory&#8217;s body was not found for another 75 years, in May 1999. Ten more expeditions were to follow before the historic climb of Everest for the first time, by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand beekeeper, and Tenzing Norgay, an acclaimed Sherpa climber. The news of the climb reached England at the time of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and Hillary became famous overnight, in all of the British Empire. Tenzing on the other hand, became a symbol of national pride across both Nepal and India.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Today, Mt Everest is drawing attention for all the negative reasons. The entire route that the climbers follow to reach the top is littered with rubbish and in sore need of cleaning up. The rubbish strewn all over the mountain includes oxygen cylinders, human waste, and even climbers&#8217; bodies which do not decompose in the extreme cold.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Under the new regulations passed by the Nepalese government, climbers scaling Everest will have to bring back eight kilograms of garbage. This amount is exclusive of the climbers&#8217; own garbage weight. This measure has been taken to restore the pristine nature of the peak.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5    The rule will be applicable to those climbers of Mt Everest who will ascend beyond Everest&#8217;s Base Camp, from April onwards. Climbers who fail to comply with this new rule are likely to be charged and legal action would be taken against them. The action would involve the paying of a fine, or other penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6    Expeditions returning back to the base will have to submit their trash at an office to be set up in the precincts of the Everest Base Camp.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    When was the first attempt to scale Mt Everest made and by whom?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What was the outcome of the first expedition?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What was the climbing record before the first successful attempt?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Who were the first successful climbers of Everest?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Why is Everest drawing attention today?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    What is the nature of the waste littering the mountainside?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    What is the nature of the new regulation?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    How were the first climbers of Everest rewarded?</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1. While it is a well known fact that yoga, certain kinds of music and some calming foods, are known to relieve stress, the latest trend is the search for certain scents with calming properties that can help a person to unwind and soothe the nerves.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2 One such scent that is now being touted as having calming properties, is lavender. It has long been a popular</span><br />
<span class="font5">ingredient used in most spas as the scent is believed to help one sleep better. To test its properties one can opt for a lotion with lavender as its ingredient. An even better option is to spray the scent on the pillow for a sound sleep.    .</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Everyone has heard of mint </span><span class="font5">chutney</span><span class="font5"> that is served with </span><span class="font5">samosas</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5">pakoras,</span><span class="font5"> but few would think of applying a mint-based paste on one&#8217;s body. Yet this is just what is recommended for those who would like a smooth and purifying effect on the mind, brought about by this application.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Citrus fruits are not only good for health but also serve as good mood lifters. Sniffing lemon zest is believed to soothe over stress and the smell of grapefruit is known to curb depression. Other advantages include memory enhancement from smelling oranges. Even the zest of an orange can make one feel energetic. Therapists also recommend that one can light an orange-scented candle by one&#8217;s side, in the bath, and imbibe the same benefits.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5 For that nagging headache that comes on whenever you step out into the scorching sun, there is yet a cure available from the array of calming scents. According to some researchers sniffing at a greeh apple cannot only cure a headache, but help alleviate it altogether.</span><br />

<p><strong><span class="font5">1.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Mt Everest has continued to attract climbers ever since June 8, 1924, when two members of a British expedition, George Mallory and Andrew Irvine, had first attempted to climb the summit. The two men were last spotted &#8216;going strong&#8217; for the top, until the clouds perpetually swirling around Everest, engulfed them. They then vanished.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Mallory&#8217;s body was not found for another 75 years, in May 1999. Ten more expeditions were to follow before the historic climb of Everest for the first time, by Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand beekeeper, and Tenzing Norgay, an acclaimed Sherpa climber. The news of the climb reached England at the time of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II and Hillary became famous overnight, in all of the British Empire. Tenzing on the other hand, became a symbol of national pride across both Nepal and India.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Today, Mt Everest is drawing attention for all the negative reasons. The entire route that the climbers follow to reach the top is littered with rubbish and in sore need of cleaning up. The rubbish strewn all over the mountain includes oxygen cylinders, human waste, and even climbers&#8217; bodies which do not decompose in the extreme cold.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Under the new regulations passed by the Nepalese government, climbers scaling Everest will have to bring back eight kilograms of garbage. This amount is exclusive of the climbers&#8217; own garbage weight. This measure has been taken to restore the pristine nature of the peak.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5    The rule will be applicable to those climbers of Mt Everest who will ascend beyond Everest&#8217;s Base Camp, from April onwards. Climbers who fail to comply with this new rule are likely to be charged and legal action would be taken against them. The action would involve the paying of a fine, or other penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">6    Expeditions returning back to the base will have to submit their trash at an office to be set up in the precincts of the Everest Base Camp.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    When was the first attempt to scale Mt Everest made and by whom?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What was the outcome of the first expedition?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What was the climbing record before the first successful attempt?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Who were the first successful climbers of Everest?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Why is Everest drawing attention today?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    What is the nature of the waste littering the mountainside?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    What is the nature of the new regulation?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    How were the first climbers of Everest rewarded?</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font5">(a)    The first attempt to scale Mt Everest was made on 8 June, 1924 by two members of a British expedition, namely George Mallory and Andrew Irvine.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    The two men were spotted going ahead to reach the peak, when they were engulfed by clouds and were never seen or heard since. Mallory&#8217;s body was discovered 75 years later.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    There were ten unsuccessful attempts before the first successful climb of Everest.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    The first successful climbers of Everest were Edmund Hillary a New Zealand beekeeper and Tenzing Norgay, a sherpa who was acclaimed by both Nepal and India.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Everest is drawing attention today because the entire route of the climb is strewn with rubbish left behind by expeditions.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    The waste littering the mountain trail consists of used oxygen cylinders, human waste, and the dead bodies of climbers that have not decomposed due to the extreme cold.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    Under the new regulation, climbers are required to bring back 8 Kilograms of garbage, excluding their own and deposit the same at the office at the Base Camp. Defaulters are liable be fined or would face penalty.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    As their feat coincided with the coronation of Britain&#8217;s Queen Elizabeth, Hilary&#8217;s feat was acknowledged all across the British Empire and Tenzing was acclaimed by India, Nepal and Tibet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1. While it is a well known fact that yoga, certain kinds of music and some calming foods, are known to relieve stress, the latest trend is the search for certain scents with calming properties that can help a person to unwind and soothe the nerves.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2 One such scent that is now being touted as having calming properties, is lavender. It has long been a popular</span><br />
<span class="font5">ingredient used in most spas as the scent is believed to help one sleep better. To test its properties one can opt for a lotion with lavender as its ingredient. An even better option is to spray the scent on the pillow for a sound sleep.    .</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Everyone has heard of mint </span><span class="font5">chutney</span><span class="font5"> that is served with </span><span class="font5">samosas</span><span class="font5"> and </span><span class="font5">pakoras,</span><span class="font5"> but few would think of applying a mint-based paste on one&#8217;s body. Yet this is just what is recommended for those who would like a smooth and purifying effect on the mind, brought about by this application.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Citrus fruits are not only good for health but also serve as good mood lifters. Sniffing lemon zest is believed to soothe over stress and the smell of grapefruit is known to curb depression. Other advantages include memory enhancement from smelling oranges. Even the zest of an orange can make one feel energetic. Therapists also recommend that one can light an orange-scented candle by one&#8217;s side, in the bath, and imbibe the same benefits.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5 For that nagging headache that comes on whenever you step out into the scorching sun, there is yet a cure available from the array of calming scents. According to some researchers sniffing at a greeh apple cannot only cure a headache, but help alleviate it altogether.</span><br />
<span class="font5">6 The latest finding about the calming properties of scents, has entered the realm of roses. Since time immemorial the flower has been associated with happiness, love and joy. With this new finding, it will now embody an additional quality &#8211; that of relieving stress. The ideal way to prove it would be to use a rose-scented soap or massage with rose-scented body oil before going under the shower.</span><br />

<span class="font5">Subject: Awareness of behaviour patterns towards challenged students</span><br />
<span class="font5">Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I wish to bring to the notice of the school authorities and school children the attitudes that should govern their interaction with challenged children in their midst. Several children have a tendency of teasing or shunning such students, while teachers are sometimes neglectful of their special wants.</span><br />
<span class="font5">These children are lacking in only one or two motor or sensory skills and understanding them by dealing with them as partners and friends in the same situation as they are, helps such children integrate into the school surroundings completely.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Striving to integrate such students into the mainstream classroom activities as far as it is feasible should be the effort of everyone in the class.</span><br />

<span class="font5">Taking a bus ride to work can save both fuel costs and boosts the economy by cutting down on fuel consumption. The environment too becomes less polluted as carbon emissions are drastically reduced with fewer vehicles plying. Bus rides are also a source of social contact because daily commuters have a chance to exchange civilities during the bus ride. Conversations cover a vast array of topics ranging from the latest political news to trivia and thus, one emerges from the ride in a positive frame of mind.</span><br />
<span class="font5">For the elderly, a comfortable bus ride is a source of self-esteem. Such people are usually dependent on family members and a comfortable alternative like a bus ride, makes them feel confident.</span><br />
<span class="font5">With a fleet Of comfortable low level buses now plying around our cities, choosing between a car ride and one on a bus is really a Hobson&#8217;s choice.</span></p>

<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">It was an old leather suitcase strapped and buckled securely. It lay above Grandmother&#8217;s Dutch armoire. I recall asking Granny about it. She simply said.</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font5">Ram Shankar rattled his stick importantly and shouting, &#8216;Hoshiyaarrr&#8230;&#8217; went towards the direction of the clatter in the lab. A pan had overturned and Shankar put it down to rats. But he was wary. Just last week, the guinea pigs had disappeared. The gardener Sultanpuri, had given a mysterious explanation for the disappearance. &#8216;They&#8217;re ghosts of former patients,&#8217; he had reasoned. Ram Shankar was beginning to believe him. But no&#8230; Why did the ghosts choose this moment to surface? He shone his torch on the ceiling and the windows and was about to latch the door when he was startled by another clatter. This time he was quick to react. In a flash, he rushed in with his torch and stave. Ram Shankar ran out faster than he had entered, his face as white as a sheet. The clatter had been caused by a snake, a rock python that had been dislodged from the scrub by construction activities and had been devouring the guinea pigs. The snake was trapped into a crate and next morning, the valuable cargo was taken to the local zoo where it now lodges and devours rats and rodents to its heart&#8217;s content.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8216;Some day, later.&#8217; The mystery deepened and curiosity got the better of me. I was on the lookout for an opportune time to pry open the locked secret within it. Granny usually went for a walk, followed by a visit to the neighbourhood temple.</span><br />
<span class="font5">I laid out the plans carefully. As soon as I saw her white sari disappear, I hoisted a chair near the armoire and climbed up. My eyes bulged with surprise for inside were heaps of old photographs, sepia tinted and fading. It was of a young Madhubala enacting scenes with a young hero. But those bewitching eyes looked familiar. Could this be Granny in her youth? But no! How could she be the famous actress Madhubala?</span><br />
<span class="font5">I had to know the answer.</span><br />
<span class="font5">When she returned home, I rushed to her with a clutch of my findings. I did not have to wait for an answer. Granny stood at the doorway to her room. Two teardrops stained her wrinkle-lined face, while a smile played round her lips. Yes, I was right. I was facing the great cine throb Madhubala, alias Granny.</span></p>

<span class="font5">(c)    The boy said that he had studied everything in school that day.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">8. Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">&#8220;John Ha Hock,&#8221; she said distinctly, &#8221; I don&#8217;t propose to do anything of the kind. In the first place they won&#8217;t exchange things bought at a bargain sale, and in the second, if you aren&#8217;t interested in the other world, I am.    ■</span><br />
<span class="font5">So there!&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    Who is the speaker and what emotion does the speaker suggest?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What does she not propose to do?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What does the term </span><span class="font5">&#8216;bargain sale&#8217;</span><span class="font5"> mean?</span><br />
<span class="font5">Round the decay</span><span class="font5">  </span><br />
<span class="font5">Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare    .</span><br />
<span class="font5">The lone and level sands stretch far away.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    What is the colossal wreck mentioned in the passage?   </span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What does the term &#8216;wreck&#8217; tell us?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Where was the statue located</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5"> (a)    The speaker is Lavinia Hallock, the wife of John Hallock. She is in an agitated state pf mind.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    She does not propose to return the Ouija board bought at a bargain sale despite her husband&#8217;s proposal to do so. She had reacted strongly to the suggestion, as is evident from the tone of the passage. ,</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    A bargain sale is a sale where goods are sold at a discount.</span><br />
<span class="font6"><sup>0r</sup></span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    The colossal wreck mentioned in the passage is that of the huge stone carving of King Ozymandias.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    The term &#8216;wreck&#8217; is a ruin of a once beautiful object, which, in this case, was a statue of King Ozymandias.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    The statue is located in a vast sandy desert that is deserted all around.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">9.    Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each. </span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    How did Patol Babu earn his living all through these years?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    How did the Ancient Mariner stop the wedding guest?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    How does Mark Antony instigate the mob?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Comment on the voice within the poet in the poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; calling him to kill the snake.  </span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Why had Ali given up hunting?</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font5">(a)    Patol Babu had a job in a railway factory when he lived, in Kanchrapara. In 1934, he was offered    higher    pay </span><span class="font5">in a clerical post with Hudson and Kimberley in Calcutta and was lucky to find a flat in Nepal Bhattacharji Lane. In 1943, a sudden retrenchment in his office due to the war, cost him his nine-year-old job. Ever since, Patol Babu was struggling to make a living. He opened a variety store which he had to wind up after five years. Then, he had a job in a Bengali firm which he gave up and then worked as an insurance salesman for ten long years and these days he was without a job.    <sub>;</sub>    .</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    The Ancient Mariner stopped the wedding guest with his skinny hands and mesmerising eyes. There was something about him which forced the guest to stay and listen to his story.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Mark Antony instigates the mob with his oratory. He exposes the plot to kill Caesar and tells the public that Caesar had always worked for the betterment of Rome. He never wanted to be the emperor and had bequeathed his legacy to the people of Rome. He reads out Caesar&#8217;s will in public to let people know the goodness of Caesar and that Brutus and Cassius had kilted Caesar because of jealousy.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Lawrence was distrustful of common education. Education according to the poet teaches us to fear snakes. On the other hand, the poet believed that there is an inner power called conscience which tells us what is right or wrong. The inner voice in the poet suggested that snakes are beautiful creatures fully equal to humans in the realm of creation.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e) Ali missed his daughter&#8217;s presence and realized the true pangs of love and separation. He realized that these </span><span class="font5">feelings of affection towards one&#8217;s family were similar among the animals and the realization made him give up hunting forever. </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">Ouija boards and tantra-mantras are used by people to communicate with the supernatural or the spirits. Do you consider it right that man should invoke these powers to help him come out of the difficulties of life or you think that God has made man powerful enough by giving him gray matter that can help him overcome all obstacles? Do you believe in supernatural forces or the power of man?</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or   </span><br />
<span class="font5">The poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; has a religious and social theme. Explain.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5"><strong>Value Points</strong>:</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Tantra-Mantras are used by weak people.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Man&#8217;s marvellous brain has created wonders.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    He has the strength of his courage and of his inner soul which help him to cope with problems.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Obstacles are not roadblocks but steps to success.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    Dealing with obstacles makes a man a mature, strong yet mellowed personality.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">The poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; has a social and religious theme. There are many lines in the poem which have social relevance. The poet says the snake came out of the &#8216;burning bowels of the earth&#8217;. This could be an allusion to hell or even a reflection by man that he does not actually respect the social rankings and only does so for lack of choice. In stanzas 6 and 7 he struggles with his conscience and the idea of killing the snake. This could be parallel to social rankings because the lower classes may always be thinking of a way to &#8216;kill&#8217; the upper class, revolts, wars, uprisings, etc. The poem has a religious theme too. &#8216;And I have something to expiate&#8217; shows the poet atoning for his sins. The use of the snake as a symbol and the battle between good and evil in the poem lends it a religious theme..</span><br />
<span class="font5">                                                   <strong>   Attempt any one — Part A or Part B </strong></span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">                                                                                  Part A</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">11. Anne felt that one could gain a lot by being close to God and nature. Explain.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Or</span><span class="font5">    ,</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Mrs. van Daan.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>Anne loved nature a lot. Every morning Anne used to go near the window and breathe in fresh air. She used to look up at the blue sky and the bare chestnut tree, on whose branches little raindrops used to shine appearing <span class="font5">like silver, and at the seagulls and other birds as they glided on the wind. Arine felt that the best remedy for those who were afraid, lonely or unhappy was to go outside where they could be quite alone with heaven, nature and God. One realises that God wishes to see people happy, amidst simple beauty of nature. She firmly believed that nature brought solace in all troubles. While Anne was there in hiding her sole connections with the nature were birds, the sky and a white horse chestnut tree outside her secret Annexe&#8217;s window. She wrote that we should think of all the beauty still left around and be happy. Anne writes&#8217; When I looked outside right into the depths of nature and God, then I was happy, really happy.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Her original name was Auguste van Pels. She was the wife of Mr van Daan, a friend of Mr Otto Frank. Though Anne disliked her immensely, she also liked her selectively. One could talk to her and she would give in easily. Helen called her an instigator. She found her really irritating when she flirted with her father. She thought that she was a flirt and a whining natured. She was always criticising Anne for one thing or the other. She was sent to various concentration camps where she died later. Mrs. van Daan is an important character in the Annexe. She is called Petronella van Daan by Anne in her diary. She is a fatalist and can be petty, egotistical, flirtatious, stingy and disagreeable. Mrs. van Daan frequently complains about the family&#8217;s situation. She always criticises the members and events in the Annexe. Anne finds that she is too critical of everything.    ,</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5"><br />
Part B</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">11. What did Helen like about Niagara where she visited in March, 1893? What did people find strange about her visit?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Michael Anagnos.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">Helen found it difficult to describe her emotions when she stood on the point which overhung the American Fall and felt the air vibrate and the earth tremble: People found it strange that Helen should be impressed by the wonders and beauties of Niagara as she was blind. They kept on asking what that beauty or that music meant to her. She couldn&#8217;t see the waves rolling up the beach or hear their roar. To Helen, the waves rolling up the beach meant a lot. She couldn&#8217;t define their meaning as she couldn&#8217;t define love or religion or goodness. A person with all their senses often overlooks the effect of touch or smell which Helen often relies on and as in this case, the vibration was so strong that Helen could sense its power. People were surprised at Helen&#8217;s fine-tuned capacity to enjoy something that to them is so visual. People questioned Helen about what the beauty of the music of the waves meant to her as she couldn&#8217;t see the waves rolling up the beach or hear their roar. But Helen had known nature since her childhood. She could enjoy and feel the beauty of nature without being able to see it even.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Michael Anagnos was the director of the Perkins Institution for the Blind. He was the one who guided Helen&#8217;s father to Miss Sullivan who came to teach her later on. It was he who sent Anne Sullivan to Keller&#8217;s home. He always encouraged Helen and understood her well. He was ecstatic when Helen sent him her first story, &#8216;The Frost King.&#8217; He got it published in the institution&#8217;s journal. Helen was accused of plagiarism for her first story. Helen thought that he would trust her and this broke her heart. He had turned a deaf ear to her pleadings of love and innocence. Years later, he tried to re-establish his links with Helen but she had lost trust in him forever.</span></p>
