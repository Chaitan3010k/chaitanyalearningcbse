<h4><span class="font5">                                                                      SECTION A- Reading</span></h4>
<p><strong><span class="font3">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1    The ship that was used by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus on his mission to discover America, has been found 500 years later, by a team headed by Barry Clifford who had gone on a mission to locate the wreck. According to the team, the ship is lying at the bottom of the sea, off the coast of Haiti. According to Barry Clifford, leader of the reconnaissance mission, all the geographical underwater topography and archeological evidence strongly suggests that this wreck is Columbus&#8217; famous flagship &#8216;Santa Maria&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="font3">2    To corroborate his findings and for identifying the wreck as the Santa Maria he has been making use of data available from separate discoveries made by other archeologists in 2003. Their findings had suggested that the region was also the probable location of Columbus&#8217; fort. With the help of his own information and that of the earlier expedition about the location of Columbus&#8217; fort, Clifford was able to use Columbus&#8217; diary and thus work the exact location of the wreck.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3    To further strengthen his search for the exact location of the ship underwater, he has carried out an examination of underwater photographs which were taken during the initial survey carried out in 2003. Combined with data from the recent reconnaissance, unearthed by divers who have gone down to the site of the wreck, Clifford&#8217;s team has been able to identify the wreck as- the Santa Maria.</span><br />
<span class="font3">4    To further strengthen their find, Clifford&#8217;s team has been using marine magnetometers, side-scan sonar equipment, in addition to divers. They have investigated more than 400 sea bed anomalies and narrowed down their search of the area where the Santa Maria is actually resting, to a tiny portion of the area.</span><br />
<span class="font3">5    The Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus&#8217; small fleet that set sail from Spain in August in 1492, under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand </span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font3">and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on, was an island in the Caribbean.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    What is the finding made by Barry Clifford and his team?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    How has Clifford corroborated his findings?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What was the find of the archeologists and how did this help Clifford?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    What equipment did Clifford use for his reconnaissance?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    How have the team narrowed down their search?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(f)    What position did the Santa Maria occupy in Columbus&#8217; fleet?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(g)    What was the aim of Columbus&#8217; expedition?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(h)    Who were his sponsors and what was the outcome of the expedition?</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font3">2.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1    With the fuel crisis looming over the Indian economy that refuses to be&#8217;wished away, any news about alternative fuels makes news. The latest finding is by some scientists who claim to have used sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make &#8216;green&#8217;jet fuel. The group consists of a consortium of European scientists who have demonstrated the production of a jet fuel, using this form of concentrated solar energy.</span><br />
<span class="font3">2    The key component of the production process is a high-temperature solar reactor developed by the group led by Professor Aldo Steinfeld. The first step in this process begins at 1500 Celsius. This heating up is done using concentrated solar radiation as the energy source. The net result that follows from this step is the production of a synthesis gas. This gas is basically a mixture of hydrogen on monoxide. This gas serves as </span><span class="font3">a precursor of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Before launching their product into the public domain, Professor Steinfeld and his team have tested their fuel by making it perform 240 consecutive cycles. The yield from these cyclic exercises they claim has led to the production of 750 litres of syngas which was then shipped </span><span class="font3">in a pressurized container, from Zurich where it was produced, to Amsterdam. A Shell research centre in the </span><span class="font3">city then converted the solar syngas into kerosene using an established method.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3    With the experiment proving successful one would suppose that the next step would be a trial run on aircraft. But instead, Steinfeld and his team are not letting their product leave the laboratories.

<p><strong><span class="font3">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1    The ship that was used by the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus on his mission to discover America, has been found 500 years later, by a team headed by Barry Clifford who had gone on a mission to locate the wreck. According to the team, the ship is lying at the bottom of the sea, off the coast of Haiti. According to Barry Clifford, leader of the reconnaissance mission, all the geographical underwater topography and archeological evidence strongly suggests that this wreck is Columbus&#8217; famous flagship &#8216;Santa Maria&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="font3">2    To corroborate his findings and for identifying the wreck as the Santa Maria he has been making use of data available from separate discoveries made by other archeologists in 2003. Their findings had suggested that the region was also the probable location of Columbus&#8217; fort. With the help of his own information and that of the earlier expedition about the location of Columbus&#8217; fort, Clifford was able to use Columbus&#8217; diary and thus work the exact location of the wreck.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3    To further strengthen his search for the exact location of the ship underwater, he has carried out an examination of underwater photographs which were taken during the initial survey carried out in 2003. Combined with data from the recent reconnaissance, unearthed by divers who have gone down to the site of the wreck, Clifford&#8217;s team has been able to identify the wreck as- the Santa Maria.</span><br />
<span class="font3">4    To further strengthen their find, Clifford&#8217;s team has been using marine magnetometers, side-scan sonar equipment, in addition to divers. They have investigated more than 400 sea bed anomalies and narrowed down their search of the area where the Santa Maria is actually resting, to a tiny portion of the area.</span><br />
<span class="font3">5    The Santa Maria was the flagship of Columbus&#8217; small fleet that set sail from Spain in August in 1492, under the sponsorship of King Ferdinand </span><span class="font7">n </span><span class="font3">and Queen Isabella I. The voyage aimed to find a westward route to China, India and the gold and spice islands of the East. But the land the sailors set eyes on, was an island in the Caribbean.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    What is the finding made by Barry Clifford and his team?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    How has Clifford corroborated his findings?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What was the find of the archeologists and how did this help Clifford?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    What equipment did Clifford use for his reconnaissance?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    How have the team narrowed down their search?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(f)    What position did the Santa Maria occupy in Columbus&#8217; fleet?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(g)    What was the aim of Columbus&#8217; expedition?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(h)    Who were his sponsors and what was the outcome of the expedition?</span><br />

<p><strong><span class="font3">2.Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1    With the fuel crisis looming over the Indian economy that refuses to be&#8217;wished away, any news about alternative fuels makes news. The latest finding is by some scientists who claim to have used sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make &#8216;green&#8217;jet fuel. The group consists of a consortium of European scientists who have demonstrated the production of a jet fuel, using this form of concentrated solar energy.</span><br />
<span class="font3">2    The key component of the production process is a high-temperature solar reactor developed by the group led by Professor Aldo Steinfeld. The first step in this process begins at 1500 Celsius. This heating up is done using concentrated solar radiation as the energy source. The net result that follows from this step is the production of a synthesis gas. This gas is basically a mixture of hydrogen on monoxide. This gas serves as </span><span class="font3">a precursor of liquid hydrocarbon fuels. Before launching their product into the public domain, Professor Steinfeld and his team have tested their fuel by making it perform 240 consecutive cycles. The yield from these cyclic exercises they claim has led to the production of 750 litres of syngas which was then shipped </span><span class="font3">in a pressurized container, from Zurich where it was produced, to Amsterdam. A Shell research centre in the </span><span class="font3">city then converted the solar syngas into kerosene using an established method.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3    With the experiment proving successful one would suppose that the next step would be a trial run on aircraft. But instead, Steinfeld and his team are not letting their product leave the laboratories. The next phase of their research includes an attempt to optimize solar reactor technology to enable them to produce their energy source efficiently. It requires that the enhanced heat transfer and fast reaction kinetics are maximized to enable the solar-to-energy conversion work with efficiency.</span><br />
<span class="font3">4    Another aspect that this group of scientists is looking at is the possibility of obtaining their feedstock of C0<sub>2</sub> from fuel gas separation, or directly from the atmospheric air. This will eliminate the second stage of the production process. In the long run, Steinfeld and his team hope to reach a 15% efficiency with the sofar-driven cyclic process.

Dear Sir<br />
<span class="font4"><strong>Subject</strong>: </span><span class="font3">Introducing handicraft stalls at tourist sites</span><br />
<span class="font3">Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to bring to the attention of your readers and the government authorities the positive fallout of placing handicraft stalls at important tourist spots. As most visitors to our town come with a very tight schedule, they have little or non time to shop for souvenirs that they would like to take back from the visit. Our rich heritage of hand-made items for both utility and decor thus remain neglected for lack of appropriate patronage. The strategic location of such outlets will also encourage our handicraft makers. Since most of them are savvy with the mobile, they will be able to service clients easily by showing them alternate designs or other modifications and book orders for future delivery, without a problem. This step will facilitate the end user who can be in constant touch with the makers long after he has returned from his memorable India tour.</span><br />

<span class="font3">Unexpected rains during our colony&#8217;s cricket tournament match had proved a complete spoilsport. We were driven indoors with only Scrabble to amuse ourselves. Before long, we were tired of word making and began narrating our wish lists. Raman, a sports fan, wished to play cricket opposite Tendulkar and Hitesh, whose father had just bought a car, said he wanted to drive a BMW; next Praveen, whose parents were unable to go on a holiday that year, wished to live in the hills permanently.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Hearing our merrymaking, my little sister, arrived and sat in our midst. Though I tried to oust her, but my friends were more sympathetic. She was allowed to make a wish and Sushila blurted out importantly; 1 would wish that a fairy godmother should give me more Curiosity.&#8217; How we guffawed at her stupidity! Whatever could one do with curiosity? But Sushila was very clear. She said, &#8216;If I had a great curiosity, I would try and find out how we can cure cancer and one day, I will surely find the answer and save so many lives.&#8217;</span><br />

<span class="font3"> When I decided to exchange places with him at the at the office I put on his best business suit and carried his briefcase </span><span class="font3">with a swagger. It appeared to be cakewalk initially. I was greeted with reverence by the juniors, the clerks and the receptionist added an extra polite &#8216;Sir&#8217; to her greeting as she sized me up in my borrowed attire.</span><br />
<span class="font3">I was brimming with excitement as I entered the boardroom where I found my empty chair in readiness. I was heading the meeting and knew nothing about the matter. When questions were posed to me, I gave off-the-cuff </span><span class="font3">answers and heads nodded in agreement. I could have continued unending in this blissful state when suddenly the </span><span class="font3">mobile in my pocket rang. It was my teacher calling up father to complain about my absence without due reason, from the school.    ’</span><br />
<span class="font3">I was in a fix because my voice would give away my secret. I sent a message saying I was in a meeting but a repeat call later, made things worse. This time it was the Principal summoning father to the office. I decided to spill the beans. Instead of a scolding, I heard a loud guffaw. The Principal&#8217;s voice was heard clearly. &#8220;Very well Navin, enjoy yourself as the Boss but be sure to be at school tomorrow and be sure to come in school instead of borrowed feathers.&#8221;</span></p>

<span class="font3">(c)    What did the citizens do after listening to the will?</span><br />

<span class="font3">(e)    What makes Helen the ghost and her co-ghosts organize the &#8216;The Writers&#8217; Inspiration Bureau&#8217;?</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font3">(a) The author&#8217;s dad was a tech-sawy person. He was crazy about computers. He couldn&#8217;t resist any of the new </span><span class="font3">gadgets or gizmos that were available in the market. He had got a Pentium 150 Mhz processor with 256 RAM, a 1.2 Gb hard disk drive and 16 speed CD ROM which could do anything— paint, play music, create displays, etc. He had a sound knowledge about computers.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    The hellish thing that the Mariner had done was the killing of the innocent Albatross without any provocation. The Albatross was a bird of good omen which had led to the blowing of the good south wind and had helped the sailors come out from the land of ice and snow.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    Cassuis was very wise and shrewd. He didn&#8217;t want Antony to be allowed to address the mob because he knew that Antony was a close friend and associate of Caesar and that Antony&#8217;s speech could instigate the mob against them. By allowing Antony to speak, Brutus made a strategic blunder and the blunder proved fatal for them.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    The once powerful king who was glorified through a grand statue is no more and even his statue was shattered into pieces, lying against the backdrop of a mighty desert.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    Helen and her co-ghosts had organized the &#8220;The Writers&#8217; Inspiration Bureau&#8217; to scout around and find writers without ideas and had a mind soft enough to be impressed by their suggestions. Thereafter ghosts were allocated to help them</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font4">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">Death is inevitable. One should not fear death but work hard to live a fruitful life without worrying about death. </span><span class="font3">Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.</span><span class="font3"> These lines of Julius Caesar appeal to you a lot and you find them very true. Write an article expressing the importance of these lines.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">&#8220;It was quite smooth sailing for some years, and Patol Babu was in his boss&#8217;s good books. In 1943, when he was just toying with the idea of starting a club in his neighbourhood sudden retrenchment in his office due to the war cost him his nine year old job. These lines from &#8216;Patol Babu, Film Star&#8217; make you realize, &#8220;What man proposes God disposes&#8221;. Write a short paragraph expressing your views about the same.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Value Points: </strong>  </span><br />
<span class="font3">•    A hero never shies away from responsibilities. He is fearless.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    When he dies he has no regrets and has the satisfaction of having tried his hardest.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    A coward runs away from responsibilities.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    He dies many times. He is always traumatised by his own fears.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    A coward denies himself of several opportunities which can make his life better and more fulfilling.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Some people have advanced degrees and diplomas in their hands but some have experience and passion for work.</span><br />
<span class="font3">I feel that those people who have a passion for work are intrinsically motivated. People are more creative when</span><br />
<span class="font3">they are more intrinsically motivated driven by interest, enjoyment, satisfaction and a sense of personal challenge </span><span class="font3">in the work they are doing. These people engage more deeply into their work. Passionate people have a fire in their eyes when they talk about their work and they have a deep desire to do their work with The utmost sincerity. Their talent grows with time as they take every opportunity that comes to them and put a lot of hard work into it. They learn from both success and failures. They put in a lot of practice into their work. They are liberated and empowered people.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font3">11. What was the change in personal life of Anne after entering the Annexe?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Or</span><span class="font3">    .</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Draw a character sketch of Peter van Daan.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font3">Anne was undergoing various changes in her attitude and thought process, since her personal life had changed considerably. She noticed Peter looking at her in an unusual way. She now was sure that Peter was also having the same feelings for her. When Peter tells her that he was often too nervous to speak to people and that he used to beat up people instead of talking to them she came to learn that Peter was also temperamental. There was a sudden change in her thought process. She had asked Kitty many questions. She wanted to know, Why people went to such lengths to hide their real selves, or why she always behaved very differently when she was in the company of others? Why did people have so little trust in one another?&#8217; She herself finds an answer. She thinks it horrible to confide in anyone, not even those closest to her.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Peter van Daan is the teenaged son of the van Daans. His real name is Peter van Pels. Anne writes about Peter as being obnoxious, lazy, and hypersensitive. But later, they become close friends. Peter is quiet, timid, honest, and sweet to Anne. He is reserved in himself. He does not share his strong convictions with anybody but later on he comes close to Anne and proves to be a strong emotional support. Anne and Peter develop a romantic attraction. Peter is Anne&#8217;s first kiss, and he is her one confidant and source of affection and attention in the Annexe.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font3">                                                                       Part</span></strong> <strong>B</strong><br />
<strong><span class="font3">11. How did Helen spend her time, at Cambridge when not studying?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font3">Draw a character sketch of Kate Keller.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font3">Helen spent her free time in the companionship of girls of her own age. She lived with several others in one of the pleasant houses connected with the school. It was the house where Mr. Howell&#8217;s used to live and they all had the advantage of home life. She joined them in many of their games. She even enjoyed blindman&#8217;s bluff and frolics in the snow. She took long walks with them. She used to discuss their studies and read aloud the things that interested them. Some of the girls learned to speak to her so that Miss Sullivan didn&#8217;t have to repeat their conversation. In the first year of her studies at Cambridge School, Helen had a lot of difficulties. But by hard work and determination, she overcame all hurdles. She finished arithmetic, reviewed her Latin grammar and read three chapters of Caesar&#8217;s &#8216;Gallic War&#8217;. In German, she read partly with her fingers and partly with Miss Sullivan&#8217;s assistance books like, Schiller&#8217;s &#8216;Hied Vonder Glocke&#8217; and &#8216;Taucher&#8217;, Heine&#8217;s &#8216;Harzreise&#8217;, Freytag&#8217;s &#8216;Aus Dem Staat Friedrices Des Grossea&#8217;, Rich&#8217;s &#8216;Fluch Der Schonheit&#8217;, Lessing&#8217;s &#8216;Minna von Barnhelm and Goethe&#8217;s &#8216;Aus meinem Leben.&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="font3"><sup>0r</sup></span><br />
<span class="font3">Kate Keller was Helen&#8217;s mother. She was the first person in the life of Helen. She was an early source of comfort to Helen Keller. As a mother, she could feel the pangs of a troubled child. She was always with Helen. She understood the needs of the troubled child and cooperated wherever it was required. She was always with Miss Sullivan. Kate Keller learned the manual alphabet from her so that she could communicate effectively with her daughter. As a mother she sometimes felt threatened by Sullivan. She found that Helen was very close to her teacher. However, soon she understood that for the sake of her daughter that deep bonded student-teacher relationship was necessary. She is a wonderful character in the novel.</span></p>
