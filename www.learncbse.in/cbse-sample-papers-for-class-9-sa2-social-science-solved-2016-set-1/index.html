<p><strong>1.Explain scientific forestry.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Who are nomads ?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> What was the Dust Bowl tragedy?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> In scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types of trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted in straight rows. This is called as plantation. Forest officials surveyed the forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and made working plans for the forest management. They planned how much of the plantation area to cut every year. The area cut was then to be replanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.<br />

Nomads are people who move from one place to another in search of food and fodder.<br />
Or<br />
It was a tragedy which occurred in the 1930s in USA. Due to overutilisation of the Prairies black blizzards became a common phenomena.</p>
<p><strong>2. Define the term ‘birth rate&#8217;.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. The ‘birth rate’ is the proportion of the number of births in a place in particular duration to the total population, usually expressed as a quantity per thousand people per year.</p>

<p><strong>7. Name an organisation which is responsible for estimating poverty.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO).</p>
<p><strong>8. What is chronic hunger ? Name any one factor responsible for chronic hunger.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. It is a consequence of diets persistently inadequate in terms of quantity and/or quality. Very low income is one of the basic causes of chronic hunger.</p>
<p><strong>9. Mention any three provisions of the forest laws passed by the Dutch.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> How did the life of pastoralists change dramatically during the colonial period ? Explain.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Why did the demand of food grains increased in England from the mid-eighteenth century ?</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) The new laws restricted villagers’ access to forest. Now, wood could only be cut for specified purposes like making river boats or constructing houses, and only from specific forests under close supervision.<br />
(ii)Villagers were punished for grazing cattle in young stands.<br />
(iii) The Dutch first imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively to provide force labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting timber.<br />
Or<br />
(i) After colonialisation, their mobility was restricted. Now the people had limited area to move.<br />
(ii)The new rulers encouraged settlement which had an adverse impact on the herds and the people.<br />
(iii) The colonies were to be used as a source of raw material, so the new rulers encouraged commercial agriculture. The pastures were converted into big farms.<br />
Or<br />
(i) Increase in population : From the mid-eighteenth century, the English population expanded rapidly. Between 1750 and 1900, it multiplied over four times, mounting from 7 million in 1750 to 21 million in 1850 and 30 million in 1900.<br />
(ii) Impact of industrialisation: Moreover, Britain at this time was industrialising. More and more people began to live and work in urban areas. Men from rural areas migrated to towns in search of jobs. To survive they had to buy foodgrains in the market. As the urban population grew, the market for foodgrains expanded, and when demand increased rapidly, foodgrain prices rose.<br />
(iii) Wars : By the end of the eighteenth century, France was at war with England. This disrupted trade and the import of foodgrains from Europe. So this created an imbalance between demand and supply.</p>
<p><strong>10. Mention any three factors which prompted the Samins to revolt against the Dutch.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> How did the pastoralists cope with the changes brought by the colonial rule ?Explan.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> How were unwilling cultivators made to produce opium in India ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (i) The nineteenth century was a turning point in forest management, and the forms of state control over the teak and non-teak forests of Java.<br />
(ii)It was the time when the bureaucrats of the colonial Forest Service drew boundaries between the forest and agricultural land on maps and in the field, and established police to restrict people’s access to trees and other forest products.<br />
(iii) The ideology of “scientific” forestry was being imposed by the colonial state and its foresters on the local people, who were the real owners of these forests.<br />
Or<br />
(i) <strong>Reduction in the number of cattle</strong>: When the grazing lands were taken over and converted into fields, this forced many nomads to reduce the number of cattle in their herds.<br />
(ii)<strong>New pastures</strong> : Defining of boundaries forced many nomads to search for new pastures. For example, after the partition of India in 1947, the camel and sheep herding Raikas, for instance, could no longer move into Sindh and graze their camels on the banks of the Indus, as they had done earlier. The new political boundaries between India and<br />
Pakistan stopped their movement. So they had to find new places to go. In recent years, they have been migrating to Haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the harvests are cut. This is the time that the fields need manure that the animals provide.<br />
(iii) New occupations : Over the years, some richer pastoralists began buying land and settling down, giving up their nomadic life. Some became settled peasants cultivating land, others took to more extensive trading. Many poor pastoralists, on the other hand, borrowed money from moneylenders to survive. At times, they lost their cattle and sheep, and became labourers, working on fields or in small towns.<br />
Or<br />
(i)In the rural areas of Bengal and Bihar, there were large number of poor peasants. They never had enough to survive. It was difficult for them to pay rent to the landlords or to buy food and clothing. The British government offered them advances to produce opium.<br />
(ii)Most of the cultivators were tempted to accept the advances. Those who accepted the advances were forced to grow opium, and hand over the produce to the agents.<br />
(iii) The British agents offered very low prices to the farmers. Due to this, most of them failed to clear the advances. So there was no option with them except to accept the new advance.</p>
<p><strong>11.&#8221;Cricket has changed with changing times and yet fundamentally remained true to its origin in rural England&#8221;. Justify by giving examples.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Explain the efforts undertaken by different Indians to design a national dress.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.(i)<strong>No specification for ground</strong>: Even after more than 300 years of its origin still there is no specification regarding the measurement of the playing ground.<br />
(ii)<strong>Equipments</strong> : Cricket&#8217;s most important tools are all made of natural, pre-industrial materials. The bat is made of wood as are the stumps and bails. The ball is made with leather, twine and cork. Even today, both bat and ball are hand-made, not industrially manufactured. The material of the bat changed slightly over time. Once it was cut out of a single piece of wood. Now it consists of two pieces, the blade which is made out of the wood of the willow tree and the handle which is made out of cane that became available as European colonialists and trading companies established themselves in Asia. Unlike golf and tennis, cricket has refused to remake its tools with industrial or man-made materials : plastic, fibre glass and metal have been firmly rejected.<br />
(iii)<strong>Protective equipment</strong>: Some of its equipments have changed with the changing time like gloves, helmet and pads. They all are manufactured by machines.<br />
Or<br />
(i) As nationalist feelings swept across India by the late nineteenth century, Indians began devising cultural symbols that would express the unity of the nation. The search for a national dress was part of this move to define the cultural identity of the nation in symbolic ways.<br />
(ii)Self-conscious experiments with dress engaged men and women of the upper classes and castes in many parts of India were conducted. The Tagore family of Bengal experimented, beginning in the 1870s, with designs for a national dress for both men and women in India. Rabindranath Tagore suggested that instead of combining Indian and European dress, India&#8217;s national dresses should combine elements of Hindu and Muslim dresses. Thus the chapkan (a long buttoned coat) was considered the most suitable dress for men.<br />
(iii)There were also attempts to develop a dress style that would draw on the tradition of different regions. In the late 1870s, Jnanadanandini Devi, wife of Satyendranath Tagore, the first Indian member of the ICS, returned from Bombay to Calcutta. She adopted the Parsi style of wearing the sari pinned to the left shoulder with a brooch, and worn with a blouse and shoes. This was quickly adopted by Brahmo Samaji women and came to be known as the Brahmika sari. This style gained acceptance before long among Maharashtrian and Uttar Pradesh Brahmos, as well as the non-Brahmos.</p>
<p><strong>12.Distinguish between summer monsoon and winter monsoon.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><br />
<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1556/24093665796_c3e7b4ba5b_o.png" alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Social Science Solved 2016 Set 1-1" width="691" height="251" /></p>
<p><strong>13. Study the given data carefully and answer the following questions :</strong><br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/23492943693_f635367c4b_o.png" alt="CBSE Sample Papers for Class 9 Social Science Solved 2016 Set 1-2" width="678" height="253" /><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>(i) Tropical(ii) Subtropical(iii) Alpine</p>
<p><strong>14.(i) What is sex ratio ?</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) Why is it considered an important social indicator ?</strong><br />
<strong> (iii)The sex ratio in the country has always remained unfavourable to females. Give two reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (i) Sex ratio is defined as the number of females per 1000 males in the population.<br />
(ii) This information is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females in a society at a given time.</p>
<p><strong>15.The Lok Sabha is more powerful than the Rajya Sabha. Explain by giving three reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Ordinary bill: Any ordinary law needs to be passed by both the Houses. But if there is a difference between the two Houses, the final decision is taken in a joint session in which members of both the Houses sit together. Because of the larger number of members, the view of the Lok Sabha is likely to prevail in such a meeting.<br />
(ii)Money bill : The Lok Sabha exercises more powers in money matters. Once the Lok Sabha passes the budget of the government or any other money-related law, the Rajya Sabha cannot reject it. The Rajya Sabha can only delay it by 14 days or suggest changes in it. The Lok Sabha may or may not accept these changes.<br />
(iii) No Confidence Motion : Most importantly, the Lok Sabha controls the Council of Ministers. Only a person who enjoys the support of the majority of the members in the Lok Sabha is appointed as the Prime Minister. If the majority of the Lok Sabha members say they have &#8216;no confidence&#8217; in the Council of Ministers, all ministers including the Prime Minister have to quit. The Rajya Sabha does not have this power.</p>
<p><strong>16. Mention three major constitutional provisions for the protection of women and children in India.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) The Right to Equality : Under this, the State can make special provisions for women and children.<br />
(ii) Right against Exploitation : (a) Under this, traffic in human beings, especially women and children, shall be an offence punishable in accordance with the law.<br />
(b) Under this, no child below the age of 14 years shall be employed to work in any factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment.</p>
<p><strong>17. Explain the major challenges to free and fair elections.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) Use of Money : Candidates and parties with a lot of money may not be sure of their victory, but they do enjoy a big and unfair advantage over smaller parties and independents.<br />
(ii) Criminals and Politics : In some parts of the country, candidates with criminal connection have been able to push others out of the electoral race, and to secure a ‘ticket’ from the major parties.<br />
(iii)Nepotism : Some families tend to dominate political parties; tickets are distributed to relatives from these families.<br />
(iv)Corrupt Politicians : Most of the candidates are corrupt, and very often, elections offer little choice to ordinary citizens.</p>
<p><strong>18. What is poverty ? Mention any three causes of poverty in India.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> Poverty is a situation in which a person is unable to get the minimum basic necessities of life, i.e., food, clothing and shelter for his or her sustenance.<br />
Causes:<br />
(i)High growth rate of population.<br />
(ii)Lack of job opportunities in the secondary sector.<br />
(iii)Income inequalities.<br />
(iv)Overdependence on agriculture.</p>
<p><strong>19. What is public distribution system (PDS) ? What are the limitations of the public distribution system ? Mention any two.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Under public distribution system or the PDS, the Government has opened more than 4.6 lakh ration shops all over the country to distribute foodgrains and other essential goods to the poor people at reasonable rates.<br />
<strong>Limitations :</strong><br />
(i) <strong>Failed to remove hunger</strong> : The PDS has been working for many years but still hunger is prevailing in the Indian society.<br />
(ii)<strong>Overflowing godowns</strong> : The FCI godowns are overflowing with foodgrains. In 2002 the stock of wheat and rice was 63 million tonnes which was much more than the minimum stock. There is a general consensus that high level of buffer stock of foodgrains is very undesirable and can be wasteful.<br />
(iii)<strong>Poor foodgrain quality</strong> : As most of godowns have more stock than their capacity this leads to deterioration in grain quality.<br />
<strong>(Mention any two points)</strong></p>
<p><strong>20. Why is there a need for food security in India ? Mention any three points.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) Overpopulation : The population of India is increasing at a very fast rate. The population of India has increased from 361 millions in 1951 to about 1027 millions in 2001.<br />
(ii)Hoarding and black marketing : There is a continuous tendency on the part of traders in India to hoard foodgrains and to accentuate the shortage of foodgrains in order to push up the prices for reaping extraordinary profit. Thus, this speculation and hoarding has created artificial crisis of foodgrains in the country.<br />
(iii)Corrupt administrative practices : To improve the food situation in the country, the government has imposed various measures like price controls, rationing, zoning, surprise checks, etc. But as the administrative machinery in India is totally corrupt thus these measures failed to reap any benefit to the general masses of the country.</p>
<p><strong>21. What is scientific forestry ? Explain the impact of the Dutch scientific forestry on the locals.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Where did the Gaddi shepherds live? Describe the seasonal movement of the Gaddis.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Which country was known as the bread basket of the world during nineteenth century ? Describe the factors responsible for the expansion of agriculture in the country.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> In scientific forestry, natural forests which had lots of different types of trees were cut down. In their place, one type of tree was planted in straight rows. This is called as plantation. Forest officials surveyed the forests, estimated the area under different types of trees, and made working plans for the forest management. They planned how much of the plantation area to cut every year. The area cut was then to be replanted so that it was ready to be cut again in some years.<br />
(1) Restrictions: Many restrictions were imposed on the people through various laws. Following were the major restrictions which were imposed on the locals :<br />
(i) Wood could only be cut for specified purposes.<br />
(ii)Wood could be cut only from specific forests under close supervision.<br />
(iii)Villagers were not allowed to graze cattle in young stands, transporting wood without a permit.<br />
(2)<strong>Blandongdiensten</strong> : The blandongdiensten system was adopted. Under this, the village was exempted from tax if the villagers worked collectively to provide free labour and animals for cutting and transporting timber.<br />
(3)<strong>Loss of Independence</strong> : Before the arrival of Dutch, the people were independent and they were using the forest according to their needs. But now, they were fully dependent on the Dutch people. They had lost their right to cultivate forests.<br />
Or<br />
(i)They spent their winter in the low hills of the Shiwalik range, grazing their flocks in the scrub forests.<br />
(ii)By April, they moved north, and spent the summer in Lahul and Spiti. When the snow melted and the high passes were clear, many of them moved on to higher mountain meadows.<br />
(iii)By September, they began their return movement.<br />
(iv)On the way, they stopped once again in the villages of Lahul and Spiti, reaping their summer harvest, and sowing their winter crop.<br />
(v) Then they descended with their flock to their winter grazing grounds, on the Shiwalik hills.<br />
Or<br />
USA was known as the bread basket of the world during the 19th century.<br />
(i)The urban population in the USA was growing, and the export market was becoming even bigger.<br />
(ii)The introduction of railways made it easy to transport the grains from the wheat growing regions to the eastern coast for export.<br />
(iii)During the war, there was no supply from Russia. So the whole supply for Europe was in the hands of USA.<br />
(iv)Introduction of machines also helped in the production.</p>
<p><strong>22. Media played very important role in making cricket a global game.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Explain how clothes were used by Gandhiji as a powerful weapon to protest against the British rule.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) <strong>Expansion in the audience</strong> : Television coverage has changed the cricket. New cricket is watched in almost all the continents of the world. It has expanded the audience for the game by beaming cricket into small towns and villages.<br />
(ii) <strong>A big industry</strong> : Television has made cricket a big industry.<br />
Coloured dress, protective helmets, field restrictions, cricket under lights became a standard part of the post-Packer game. Cricket boards became rich by selling television rights to television companies. Television channels are making money by selling television spots to companies who were happy to pay large sums of money to air commercials for their products to cricket’s captive television audience.<br />
(iii)<strong>Cricketers as celebrities</strong> : Continuous television coverage has made cricketers celebrities who, besides being paid better by their cricket boards, are now making even larger sums of money by doing commercials for a wide range of products, from tyres to colas on television.<br />
(iv)<strong>Shift in the centre of gravity</strong> : Television has shifted balance of power in cricket. Since India had the largest viewership for the game amongst the cricket-playing nations, and the largest market in the cricketing world, the game’s centre of gravity shifted to South Asia. This shift was symbolised by the shifting of the ICC headquarters from London to tax-free Dubai.<br />
(v) <strong>Improvement in the game</strong> : The ICC, which is the governing body, has made it compulsory to telecast international matches. Now, the third empire has been introduced, and television is also being used to improve the game.<br />
Or<br />
The experiment with Swadeshi gave Mahatma Gandhi important ideas about using cloth as a symbolic weapon against British rule.<br />
(i) He made spinning on the charkha and daily use of Khadi, or coarse cloth made from homespun yarn, very powerful symbols. These were not only symbols of self-reliance but also of resistance to the use of British mill-made cloth.<br />
(ii)In Durban in 1913, Gandhiji first appeared in a lungi and kurta with his head shaved as a sign of mourning to protest against the shooting of Indian coal miners.<br />
(iii)On his return to India in 1915, he decided to dress like a Kathiawadi peasant.<br />
(iv)He adopted the short dohti in 1921 and wore it until his death because according to him it was the dress of a poor Indian.<br />
(v) Khadi, white and coarse was to him a sign of purity, of simplicity and of poverty. Wearing it became also a symbol of nationalism, a rejection of western mill-made cloth.</p>
<p><strong>23. Describe how the location and relief are important factors in determining the climate of India.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. (i) India is located between 8°4<sup>,</sup>N and 37°6&#8217;N lattitude and 68°7&#8217;E to 97°25&#8217;E longitude. India is divided into almost two equal parts by the Tropic of Cancer.<br />
(ii)It is near the Equator so a tropical type of climate is found.<br />
(iii)The Himalayas protects us from the northern chilly winds.<br />
(iv)The location of the sea on the three sides of India has exerted a moderating influence.<br />
(v)The water bodies act as a storehouse of badly needed moisture.</p>
<p><strong>24. Explain the main reasons for the rapid increase in India’s population since independence.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i)<strong> High Birth Rate and Low Death Rate</strong> : From 1921 to 2011, the death rate has fallen from 42.6 to 7.48 per thousand while the birth rate fell from 49.2 to 20.97 per thousand.<br />
(ii)<strong>Poverty</strong> : Poor people have to spend little on the upbringing of their offsprings. Besides, the children supplement the family income.<br />
(iii)<strong>Child Marriage</strong> : Early marriage is a common feature in India. About 90 per cent of girls are married in the age group of 15-20 years.<br />
(iv)<strong>Low Status of Women</strong> : In India women have a low social status. They are treated merely as child producing machines.<br />
(v)<strong>Illiteracy</strong> : Rate of illiteracy of 26 per cent is pretty high in India. Illiterate persons fail to understand the significance of family planning.</p>
<p><strong>25.Explain the role of the Election Commission in free and fair elections.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. (i) Allotment of Election Symbols: The political parties of national standing are allotted permanent election symbols. These symbols help even an ordinary man to recognise the different parties instantly.<br />
(ii) Preparation of Electoral Rolls: Electoral Rolls are prepared in which the name, father’s name, age and sex of the voters are clearly mentioned.<br />
(iii) Delimitation of Constituencies: The whole area where elections are held, is divided into so many clear-cut constituencies, so that elections are held in an organised way.<br />
(iv) Fixing the Election Dates : The Election date is announced so that the voters could easily cast their votes on that particular date.<br />
(v) Scrutiny (careful examination) of Nomination Papers : The candidates willing to contest the elections have to file the nominations up to a particular date. Then the Election Commission scrutinizes their papers and accepts or rejects the nomination papers as the case may be.</p>
<p><strong>26. What are the chief characteristics of the Fundamental Rights ?Mention any five.</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> (i) Universal: These rights are universal means. They are for all the citizens of India without any discrimination.<br />
(ii) Restrictions : Our rights are not absolute. There are certain restrictions imposed on each of them.<br />
(iii)Justiciable : Fundamental Rights are justiciable means. Citizens can move to the court if any individual or Government is violating his/her rights.<br />
(iv)Comprehensive : These rights have comprehensive approach. They tend to safeguard our social, economic, cultural and religious interests.<br />
(v)Suspendable : These rights can be suspended in the event of National Emergency.</p>
