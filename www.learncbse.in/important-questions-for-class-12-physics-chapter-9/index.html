<h4>Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Aglasslensof refractive index 1.5 is placed in a trough of liquid. What must be the refractive index of the liquid in order to mark the lens disappear? (Delhi 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
In order to make the lens disappear the refractive index of liquid must be equal to 1.5 i.e. equal to that of glass lens.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
A converging lens of refractive index 1.5 is kept in a liquid medium having same refractive index. What would be the focal length of the lens in this medium? (Delhi 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
The lens in the liquid will act like a plane sheet of glass<br />
∴ Its focal length will be infinite (∞)<br />

<p>Question 3.<br />
How does the power of a convex lens vary, if the incident red light is replaced by violet light? (Delhi 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
According to Lens Maker&#8217;s formula<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116295" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 2" width="231" height="68" /><br />
∴ power of the lens will be increased.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How does the angle of minimum deviation of a glass prism vary, if the incident violet light is replaced with red light? (All India 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
We know that λ red &gt; λ violet, therefore µ red &lt; µ violet and hence δ red &lt; δ violet.<br />
When incident violet light is replaced with red light, the angle of minimum deviation of a glass decreases.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Why does the bluish colour predominate in a clear sky? (All India 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
Blue colour of the sky : The scattering of light by the atmosphere is a colour dependent. According to Rayleigh&#8217;s law, the intensity of scattered light \(\mathrm{I} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}\), blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. Therefore, the colour of sky becomes blue. The blue component of light is proportionately more in the light coming from different parts of the sky. This gives the impression of the blue sky.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />

Answer:<br />
Converging.</p>
<p>Question 28.<br />
Why does bluish colour predominate in a clear sky? (All India 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
Blue colour of the sky : The scattering of light by the atmosphere is a colour dependent. According to Rayleigh&#8217;s law, the intensity of scattered light \(\mathrm{I} \propto \frac{1}{\lambda^{4}}\), blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. Therefore, the colour of sky becomes blue. The blue component of light is proportionately more in the light coming from different parts of the sky. This gives the impression of the blue sky.</p>
<p>Question 29.<br />
When an object is placed between f and 2f of a concave mirror, would the image formed be<br />

How does the angle of minimum deviation of a glass prism vary, if the incident violet light is replaced by red light? Give reason. (Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle of minimum deviation decreases, when violet light is replaced by red light because refractive index for violet light is more than that for red light.</p>
<p>Question 31.<br />
An object is kept in front of a concave lens. What is the nature of the image formed? (Comptt. Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
When an object is kept in front of a concave lens, the nature of image formed is virtual, erect and diminished.</p>
<p>Question 32.<br />
When light travels from a rarer medium to denser medium, the speed of light decreases. Does the reduction in speed imply a reduction in the energy? (Comptt. Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
The reduction in speed, due to light travelling from a rarer to denser medium does not imply reduction in the energy.</p>
<p>Question 33.<br />
The objective lenses of two telescopes have the same apertures but their focal lengths are in the ratio 1: 2. Compare the resolving powers of the two telescopes. (Comptt. All India 2017)<br />

(ii) Advantages of reflecting telescope over a refracting telescope:</p>
<ol>
<li>Due to large aperture of the mirror used, the reflecting telescopes have high resolving power.</li>
<li>This type of telescope is free from chromatic aberration (formation of coloured image of a white object).</li>
<li>The use of paraboloidal mirror reduces the spherical aberration (formation of non-point, blurred image of a point object).</li>
<li>Image formed by reflecting telescope is brighter than refracting telescope.</li>
<li>A lens of large aperture tends to be very heavy and therefore difficult to make and support by its edges. On the other hand, a mirror of equivalent optical quality weights less and can be supported over its entire back surface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 36.<br />
Draw a ray diagram of an astronomical telescope in the normal adjustment position. State two drawbacks of this type of telescope. (Delhi 2008)<br />

<p>Question 46.<br />
(a) The bluish colour predominates in clear sky.<br />
(b) Violet colour is seen at the bottom of the spectrum when white light is dispersed by a prism.<br />
State reasons to explain these observations. (Delhi 2010)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The scattering of light by the atmosphere is colour dependent. According to Rayleigh&#8217;s law, the intensity of scattered light, \(I \propto \frac{1}{\lambda_{4}}\)</p>
<p>Blue light is scattered much more strongly than red light. The blue component of light is proportionately more in the light coming from different parts of the sky. This gives the impression of the blue sky.</p>
<p>(b) As refractive index of prism is different for different colours, therefore, different colours deviate through different angles on passing through the prism. As λ<sub>violet</sub> &lt; λ<sub>red</sub> therefore µ<sub>violet</sub> &gt; µ<sub>red</sub>. Hence δ<sub>violet</sub> &gt; δ<sub>red</sub> maximum deviation is of violet colour. That is why violet colour, is seen at the bottom of the spectrum when white light is dispersed by a prism.</p>

<p>Question 48.<br />
(i) Why does the Sun appear reddish at sun-set or sun-rise?<br />
(ii) For which colour the refractive index of prism material is maximum and minimum? (Delhi 2009).<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) During Sunrise or sunset, the Sun is near the horizon. Sunlight has to travel a greater distance. So shorter waves of blue region are scattered away by the atmosphere. Red waves of longer wavelength are least scattered and reach the observer. So the Sun appears reddish.<br />
(ii) Refractive index of prism material is maximum for violet colour and refractive index of prism material is minimum for red colour.</p>

<p>Question 60.<br />
Draw a ray diagram showing the image formation by a compound microscope. Hence obtain the expression for total magnification when the image is formed at infinity. (Delhi 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
Ray Diagram:<br />
(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />

Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

<p>Question 75.<br />
Why does white light disperse when passed through a glass prism?<br />
Using lens maker&#8217;s formula, show how the focal length of a given lens depends upon the colour of light incident on it. (Comptt. Delhi 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) The white light disperses when passed through a prism, because the refractive index of the glass of the prism is different for different wavelengths (colours). Hence, different colours get bent along different directions.</p>
<p>(ii) Using lens maker&#8217;s formula,<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116361" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-65.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 65" width="304" height="94" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-65.png 304w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-65-300x93.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px" /><br />
As the refractive index of the medium (n<sub>2</sub>) (glass) with respect to air (n<sub>1</sub>) depends on the wavelength or colour of light, therefore focal length of the lens would change with colour.</p>

Incident angle in the surface ac is 45° for all the three colours. So red colour will undergo refraction while the other two colours will undergo total internal reflection in a.c. It is indicated in the figure. All the three colours will undergo total internal reflection if they are incident normally on one of the faces of an equilateral prism as shown in Figure 3. This is due to the reason that the incident angle on the second surface will be greater than critical angle for all the colours.<br />

<p>Question 86.<br />
(i) Draw a neat labelled ray diagram of an astronomical telescope in normal adjustment. Explain briefly its working.<br />
(ii) An astronomical telescope uses two lenses of powers 10 D and 1 D. What is its magnifying power in normal adjustment? (All India 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Magnifying power m = \(-\frac{f_{0}}{f_{e}}\). It does not change with increase of aperature of objective lens, because focal length of a lens has no concern with the aperature of lens.<br />

<p>Question 87.<br />
(i) Draw a neat labelled ray diagram of a compound microscope. Explain briefly its working.<br />
(ii) Why must both the objective and the eye-piece of a compound microscope have short focal lengths? (All India 2010)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i)<br />
(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />

Magnification due to a compound microscope.<br />
The ray diagram shows that the (linear) magnification due to the objective, namely h&#8217;/h, equals<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116502" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 192" width="344" height="82" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png 344w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><br />
Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

It shows that lens infinite.<br />
Hence for lens L<sub>1</sub>, image is formed at a distance of 15 cm from L<sub>2</sub><br />
∴ the focus of L<sub>2</sub> i.e. u<sub>2</sub> = 15 cm<br />
Now, to calculate the distance between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>,<br />
u<sub>1</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> = 60 + 15 = 75 cm<br />
Distance between L<sub>2</sub> and L<sub>3</sub> = v<sub>2</sub> + v<sub>3</sub> = ∞ or can be any value.</p>

<p>Question 105.<br />
Draw a ray diagram showing the image formation by a compound microscope when the final image is formed at the near point.<br />
Define the resolving power of a microscope. Write two factors by which resolving power can be increased. (Comptt. All India 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116501" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 191" width="305" height="215" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191.png 305w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /><br />
Magnification due to a compound microscope.<br />
The ray diagram shows that the (linear) magnification due to the objective, namely h&#8217;/h, equals<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116502" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 192" width="344" height="82" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png 344w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><br />
Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

<p>Question 111.<br />
(a) Draw a labelled ray diagram showing the formation of a final image by a compound microscope at least distance of distinct vision.<br />
(b) The total magnification produced by a compound microscope is 20. The magnification produced by the eye piece is 5. The microscope is focussed on a certain object. The distance between the objective and the eyepiece is observed to be 14 cm. If least distance of distinct vision is 20 cm, calculate the focal length of the objective and the eye piece. (Delhi 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />

Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

Advantage over refracting telescope :</p>
<ol>
<li>Since reflecting telescope has mirror objective, so the image formed is free from chromatic aberration.</li>
<li>Since the spherical mirrors are parabolic mirrors, free from spherical aberration, they produce a very sharp and distinct image.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 123.<br />
Explain the following, giving reasons :<br />
(i) When monochromatic light is incident on a surface separating two media, the reflected and refracted light both have the same frequency as the incident frequency.<br />
(ii) When light travels from a rarer to a denser medium, the speed decreases. Does this decrease in speed imply a reduction in the energy carried by the wave?<br />
(iii) In the wave picture of light, intensity of light is determined by the square of the amplitude of the wave. What determines the intensity in the photon picture of light? (All India 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Reflection and refraction arise through interaction of incident light with atomic constituents of matter which vibrate with the same frequency as that of the incident light. Hence frequency of reflected and refracted light both have the same frequency as the incident frequency.</p>
<p>(ii) No, energy carried by a wave depends on the amplitude of the wave and not on the speed of wave propagation.</p>
<p>(iii) For a given frequency, intensity of light in the photon picture is determined by the number of photons incident normally on crossing a unit area per unit time.</p>
<p>Question 124.<br />
A convex lens, of focal length 25 cm, and a convex mirror, of radius of curvature 20 cm, are placed co-axially 40 cm apart from each other. An incident beam, parallel to the principal axis, is incident on the convex lens. Find the position and nature of the image formed by this combination. (Comptt. All India 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
The given &#8216;setup&#8217; is as shown<br />
The object, being at infinity, the image formed by the convex lens, is at its focus, i.e. 25 cm from the lens. This image becomes the &#8216;object&#8217; for convex mirror.<br />
Now, for the convex mirror<br />
Object distance = (40 &#8211; 25) cm = 15 cm<br />
Radius of curvature, R = 20 cm<br />
u = -15 cm, R = +20 cm<br />
Using the mirror formula :<br />

<p>Question 126.<br />
(a) Monochromatic light of wavelength 589 nm is incident from air on a water surface. If p for water is 1.33, find the wavelength, frequency and speed of the refracted light.<br />
(b) A double convex lens is made of a glass of refractive index 1.55, with both faces of the same radius of curvature. Find the radius of curvature required, if the focal length is 20 cm. (All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Given : Wavelength of monochromatic<br />
light, λ = 589 nm = 589 × 10<sup>-9</sup>m,<br />
Refractive index of water, µ = 1.33,<br />
Speed of light in air, c = 3 × 10<sup>8</sup> ms<sup>-1</sup><br />
Frequency of light does not depend on the property of the medium in which it is travelling. Hence, the frequency of the emergent ray in water will be equal to the frequency of the incident or emergent light in air.<br />

<p>(b) You are given the following three lenses. Which two lenses will you use as an eyepiece and as an objective to construct a compound microscope?<br />
(c) Define resolving power of a microscope and write one factor on which it depends.<br />
(All India)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Compound microscope :</p>
<p>(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />

Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

<p>Question 131.<br />
Answer the following questions:<br />
(a) Plane and convex mirrors produce virtual images of objects. Can they produce real images under some circumstances? Explain<br />
(b) A virtual image, we always say, cannot be caught on a screen. Yet when we &#8216;see&#8217; a vitrual image, we are obviously bringing it on to the &#8216;screen&#8217; (i.e. the retina) of our eye. Is there a contradiction?<br />
(c) A diver under water, looks obliquely at a fisherman standing on the bank of a lake. Would the fisherman look taller or shorter to the diver than what he actually is?<br />
(d) Does the apparatus depth of a tank of water change if viewed obliquely? If so, does the apparatus depth increase or decrease?<br />
(e) The refractive index of diamond is much greater than that of ordinary glass. Is this fact of some use to a diamond cutter? (Comptt. Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Rays converging to a point &#8216;behind&#8217; a plane or convex mirror are reflected to a point in front of the mirror on a screen. In other words, a plane or convex mirror can produce a real image if the object is virtual. Convince yourself by drawing an appropriate ray diagram.</p>
<p>(b) When the reflected or refracted rays are divergent, the image is virtual. The divergent rays can be converged on to a screen by means of an appropriate converging lens. The convex lens of the eye does just that. The virtual image here serves as an object for the lens to produce a real image. Note, the screen here is not located at the position of the virtual image. There is no contradiction.</p>
<p>(c) Taller</p>
<p>(d) The apparent depth for oblique viewing decreases from its value for near-normal viewing. Convince yourself of this fact by drawing ray diagrams for different positions of the observer.</p>
<p>(e) Refractive index of a diamond is about 2.42, much larger than that of ordinary glass (about 1.5). The critical angle of diamond is about 24°, much less than that of glass. A skilled diamond-cutter exploits the larger range of angles of incidence (in the diamond), 24° to 90°, to ensure that light entering the diamond is totally reflected from many faces before getting out, thus producing a sparkling effect.</p>

(ii) Advantages of reflecting telescope over a refracting telescope:</p>
<ol>
<li>Due to large aperture of the mirror used, the reflecting telescopes have high resolving power.</li>
<li>This type of telescope is free from chromatic aberration (formation of coloured image of a white object).</li>
<li>The use of paraboloidal mirror reduces the spherical aberration (formation of non-point, blurred image of a point object).</li>
<li>Image formed by reflecting telescope is brighter than refracting telescope.</li>
<li>A lens of large aperture tends to be very heavy and therefore difficult to make and support by its edges. On the other hand, a mirror of equivalent optical quality weights less and can be supported over its entire back surface.</li>

<p>Question 147.<br />
(a) Draw a ray diagram showing the image formation by a compound microscope. Obtain expression for total magnification when the images is formed at infinity.<br />
(b) How does the resolving power of a compound microscope get affected, when<br />
(i) focal length of the objective is decreased.<br />
(ii) the wavelength of light is increased? Give reasons to justify your answer.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Ray diagram of a compound microscope : A schematic diagram of a compound microscope is shown in the figure. The lens nearest the object, called the objective, forms a real, inverted, magnified image of the object. This serves as the object for the second lens, the eyepiece, which functions essentially like a simple microscope or magnifier, produces the final image, which is enlarged and virtual. The first inverted image is thus near (at or within) the focal plane of the eyepiece, at a distance appropriate for final image formation at infinity, or a little closer for image formation at the near point. Clearly, the final image is inverted with respect to the original object.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116501" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 191" width="305" height="215" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191.png 305w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-191-300x211.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 305px) 100vw, 305px" /><br />
Magnification due to a compound microscope.<br />
The ray diagram shows that the (linear) magnification due to the objective, namely h&#8217;/h, equals<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116502" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 9 Ray Optics and Optical Instruments Class 12 Important Questions 192" width="344" height="82" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192.png 344w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-9-Ray-Optics-and-Optical-Instruments-Class-12-Important-Questions-192-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 344px) 100vw, 344px" /><br />
Here h&#8217; is the size of the first image, the object size being h and f<sub>0</sub> being the focal length of the objective. The first image is formed near the focal point of the eyepiece. The distance L, i.e., the distance between the second focal point of the objective and the first focal point of the eyepiece (focal length f<sub>e</sub>) is called the tube length of the compound microscope.</p>
<p>As the first inverted image is near the focal point of the eyepiece, we use for the simple microscope to obtain the (angular) magnification me due to it when the final image is formed at the near point, is<br />

A plot between the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in the figure. In general, any given value of δ, except for i = e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e. This, in fact, is expected from the symmetry of i and e in equation (i) above, i.e., δ remains the same if i and e are. interchanged. Physically, this is related to the fact that the path of ray in the diagram above can be traced back, resulting in the same angle of deviation.

Since final image (I<sub>3</sub>) is formed at the focus of L<sub>3</sub>, the rays emerging from L<sub>2</sub> and incident on L<sub>3</sub> have to be parallel to principal axis.<br />
Since the object is placed at a distance of 60 cm from L<sub>1</sub> i.e., at 2F; the image will be formed at 2F on the other side of L<sub>1</sub> (60 cm).<br />
This image I<sub>1</sub> will be at the focus of L<sub>2</sub>, because rays emerging out from L<sub>2</sub> are parallel to principal axis.<br />

<p>Question 156.<br />
(a) Deduce the expression, by drawing a suitable ray diagram, for the refractive index of triangular glass prism in terms of the angle of minimum deviation (D) and the angle of prism (A).<br />
Draw a plot showing the variation of the angle of deviation with the angle of incidence.<br />
(b) Calculate the value of the angle of incidence when a ray of light incident on one face of an equilateral glass prism produces the emergent ray, which just grazes along the adjacent face. Refractive index of the prism is \(\sqrt{2}\). (Comptt. All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The figure shows the passage of light through a triangular prism ABC. The angles of incidence and refraction at the first face AB are i and rv while the angle of incidence (from glass to air) at the second face AC is r2 and the angle of refraction or emergence e. The angle between the emergent ray RS and the direction of the incident ray PQ is called the angle of deviation δ.<br />

A plot between the angle of deviation and angle of incidence is shown in the figure. In general, any given value of δ, except for i = e, corresponds to two values i and hence of e. This, in fact, is expected from the symmetry of i and e in equation (i) above, i.e., δ remains the same if i and e are. interchanged. Physically, this is related to the fact that the path of ray in the diagram above can be traced back, resulting in the same angle of deviation. At the minimum deviation dm, the refracted ray inside the prism becomes parallel to its base. We have,<br />
