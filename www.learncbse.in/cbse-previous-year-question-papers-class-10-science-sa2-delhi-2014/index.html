<p><strong>Question.6. Why is Government of India imposing a ban on the use of polythene bags? Suggest two alternatives to these bags and explain how this ban is likely to improve the environment.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Plastic bags are non-biodegradable which can not be broken down into non-poisonous substances in nature.<br />
Plastic bags are the main cause of sewer blockages as plastic bags are not decomposed by micro-organisms.<br />
Plastic bags if eaten by stray animals (like cows) can block their alimentary canal.<br />
Two alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>We should take our own jute or cloth bags while going for purchasing articles from the market.</li>
<li>Disposable paper cups should be used for serving tea in trains instead of plastic cups.</li>
<li>Shopkeepers can use paper bags instead of plastic bags.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.7. State the meaning of functional group in a carbon compound. Write the functional group present in (i) ethanol and (ii) ethanoic acid and also draw their structures.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> An &#8216;atom&#8217; or &#8216;a group of atoms&#8217; which makes a carbon compound reactive and decides its properties (or functions) is called a functional group. .<br />
(i) Ethanol —&gt; Alcohol group (—OH)<br />
(ii) Ethanoic acid —&gt; carboxylic acid group (—COOH)<br />

<p><strong>Question.8. Write the name and general formula of a chain of hydrocarbons in which an addition reaction with hydrogen can take place. Stating the essential conditions required for an addition reaction to occur write the chemical equation giving the name of the reactant and the product of such a reaction.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Addition reactions are a characteristic property of unsaturated hydrocarbons, i.e., Alkenes and Alkynes.<br />
General formula of—Alkene: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>, Alkyne: C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub><br />
For example, Ethene undergoes addition reaction with hydrogen when heated in the presence of nickel catalyst to form ethane saturated hydrocarbon.<br />

<p><strong>Question.10. (a) Define the following terms:</strong><br />
<strong> (i) Valency; (ii) Atomic size</strong><br />
<strong> (b) How do the valency and the atomic size of the elements vary while going from left to right along a period in the modem periodic table?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) (i) Valency. The combining capacity of an element is called its valency.<br />
• The valency of an element is determined by the number of valence electrons present in the atom of the element.<br />
• The number of electrons lost or gained or shared by one atom of an element to achieve the nearest inert gas configuration gives the valency of the element.<br />
(ii)Atomic size. The atomic size of an atom is the distance between the centre of the nucleus and outermost electron shell of an isolated atom.<br />
(b) -On moving from left to right along a period in the modem periodic table, the valency of elements increases from 1 to 4 and then decreases to zero.<br />
-On moving from left to right in a period of the periodic table, the size of the atoms decreases.</p>
<p><strong>Question.11. Draw diagrams to explain the regeneration that takes place in each of the body parts of planaria when its body is cut into three pieces. Name any other organism in which a similar process can be observed.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> The process of getting back a full organism from its body parts is called regeneration. The simple animals like hydra and planaria show regeneration.<br />
Diagram for regeneration in planaria. See Q. 24(b), 2011 (I Delhi).</p>
<p><strong>Question.12. List any four methods of contraception used by humans. How does their use have a direct effect on the health and prosperity of a family?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> There are three different methods of contraception:</p>
<ol>
<li>Barrier methods. In these methods, physical devices such as condoms, diaphragm and cervical caps are used. These devices prevent the entry of sperm in the female genital tract, thus acting as a barrier between them.</li>
<li> Surgical methods. There are surgeries that can be carried out in males and females. In males, a small portion of the sperm duct (vas deferens) is blocked by surgical operation. It prevents the egg to reach the uterus. In both the cases, fertilisation will not take place.</li>
<li>Chemical methods. This category of contraceptive acts by changing the hormonal balance of the body so that eggs are not released and fertilisation cannot occur. Females use two types of pills for preventing pregnancies, i.e., oral pills and vaginal pills. The oral pills contain hormones which stop the ovaries from releasing ovum into the fallopian tube. This is also called oral contraceptives (OC).</li>
<li>Other contraceptive devices such as loop or the copper-T are placed in the uterus to . prevent pregnancy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Effect on health and prosperity of a family:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Contraceptive methods are used to prevent the spreading of sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, AIDS, etc.</li>
<li>Contraceptive methods are also used to control human population by checking the unwanted pregnancies during sexual activities.</li>
<li>It helps in family planning by controlling the number of children in the family, thereby reducing the chances of financial burden and poverty.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.13. (a) Give the evidence that the birds have evolved from reptiles.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Insects, octopus, planaria and vertebrates possess eyes. Can we group these animals together on the basis of eyes that they possess? Justify your answer giving reason.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) A fossil bird called Archaeopteryx looks like a bird but it has many features which are found in reptiles. Archaeopteryx has feathered wings like birds but teeth and tail like those of reptiles. Therefore Archaeopteryx is a connecting link between the reptiles and birds and hence suggests that the birds have evolved from the reptiles.<br />
(b) Insects, octopus, planaria and vertebrates posses eyes but these animals can not be put together on the basis of eyes because the structure of eyes in each of. there &#8216; organisms is different which suggests their separate evolutionary origins. Thus all<br />
these animals are put in different groups.</p>
<p><strong>Question.14. A cross was made between pure breeding pea plants, one with round and green seeds and the other with wrinkled and yellow seeds.</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Write the phenotype of F<sub>1</sub> progeny. Give reason for your answer.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Write the different types of F<sub>2</sub> progeny obtained along with their ratio when F<sub>1 </sub>progeny was selfed.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) The cross was made between round, green seeds and wrinkled, yellow seeds. In the given cross, were taken into account, which is a dihybrid cross.<br />
Yellow colour and round shape is dominant over green colour and wrinkled shape.<br />
<img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5702/30236006340_ef0d3782ed_o.png" alt="cbse-previous-year-question-papers-class-10-science-sa2-delhi-2014-25" width="426" height="235" /><br />
The above cross shows round and yellow seeds in generation. It occurs because dominant traits (round and yellow) express themselves, whereas recessive traits (wrinkled and green) get suppressed.<br />

<p><strong>Question.16. State the laws of refraction of light. If the speed of light in vacuum is 3 x 10<sup>8</sup> ms-1, find the speed of light in a medium of absolute refractive index 1.5.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Laws of refraction of light:</p>
<ol>
<li>The incident, the refracted ray and the normal at the point of incidence, all lie in the same plane.</li>
<li>The second law of refraction is called Snell&#8217;s law of refraction. According to Snell&#8217;s law, &#8220;The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is a constant for a given pair of mediums&#8221;.<br />

<p><strong>Question.17. Explain giving reason why the sky appears blue to an observer from the surface of the earth? What will the colour of the sky be for an astronaut staying in the international space station orbiting the earth? Justify your answer giving reason.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Sky appears blue. The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have a size smaller than the wavelength of visible light. So these particles scatter more effectively the light rays of shorter wavelength at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end. When the scattered blue light enters our eyes, it gives us the feeling of a blue sky.<br />
Colour of sky to an astronaut. There, is no atmosphere containing air in space to scatter sunlight. As there is no scattering of light in space, the scattered light does not reach the eyes and the sky appears dark instead of blue to an astronaut in outer space.</p>
<p><strong>Question.18. Our food grains such as wheat and rice, the vegetables and fruits and even meat are found to contain varying amounts of pesticide residues.&#8221; State the reason to explain how and why it happens?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Pesticides are poisonous chemical substances which are sprayed over crop plants to protect them from pests and diseases. These pesticides mix up with soil and water and are then absorbed by growing plants along with water and other minerals.. Thus pesticides enter the food chain at the producer level (plant level) and in the process s of transfer of food through food chains these harmful chemicals get concentrated at each trophic level. These chemicals are non-biodegradable, so they get accumulated at each trophic level. Pesticides present in wheat grains, fruits vegetables and meat cannot always be removed by washing, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Question.19. State the reason why carbon can neither form C<sup>4+</sup> cations nor C<sup>4-</sup> anions, but forms covalent compounds. Also state reasons to explain why covalent compounds:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) are bad conductors of electricity?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) have low melting and boiling points?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Carbon atoms have 4 electrons in their outermost shell. So needs to gain or lose electrons to attain noble gas configuration.<br />
— It could gain four electrons forming C<sup>4-</sup> anion. But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons.<br />
— It could lose four electrons forming C<sup>4+</sup> cation. But it would require a large amount energy to remove four electrons from its outermost shell.<br />
Because of these reasons, carbon shares its valence electrons to complete its octet with other atoms to form covalent bonds.<br />
(a) Covalent compounds are bad conductors of electricity because they do not contain ions.<br />
(b) Covalent compounds have usually low melting and boiling points because they are made up of electronically neutral molecules. So the force of attraction between the molecules of a covalent compound is very weak. Only a small amount of heat energy is required to break these weak molecular forces, due to which covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points.</p>
<p><strong>Question.20. (a) Give one example each of a unisexual and a bisexual flower.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Mention the changes a flower undergoes after fertilisation.</strong><br />
<strong> (c) How does the amount of DNA remain constant though each new generation is a</strong><br />
<strong> combination of DNA copies of two individuals?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) Unisexual Flower — Papaya Bisexual Flower — Hibiscus<br />
(b) After fertilisation, the fertilised egg divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule. The ovule, develops a tough coat around it and is gradually converted into a seed (containing the baby plant along with food). The ovary of flower develops and becomes a fruit (with seeds inside it). The other parts of flower like sepals, petals, stamens, stigma and style dry up and fall off. Only the vary is left behind.<br />
(c) In sexual reproduction, though the genetic material DNA from two gametes, male and female gametes, combine together to form a new cell &#8216;zygote&#8217; but the amount of DNA in zygote does not get doubled. This is because the gametes are special type of cells which contain only half the amount of DNA as compared to the normal body cells of an organism. So the new cell zygote formed by two gametes cells will have the normal amount of DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Question.21. (a) Name the respective part of human female reproductive system:</strong><br />
<strong> (i) that produces eggs.</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) where fusion of egg and sperm takes place, and</strong><br />
<strong> (iii) where zygote get implanted.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Describe in brief what happens to the zygote after it gets implanted.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) Part of human female reproductive system:<br />
(i) that produces eggs—Ovary<br />
(ii) where fusion of egg and sperm takes place—Fallopian tube<br />
(iii) where zygote get implanted—Uterus<br />
(b) After zygote gets implanted, a disc like special tissue develops between the uterus wall and embryo (foetus) which is called placenta. The foetus is connected to the placenta in the mother&#8217;s body through the umbilical cord. The exchange of nutrients, oxygen and waste products between the embryo and the mother takes place through the placenta.</p>
<p><strong>Question.22. A student wants to project the image of a candle flame on the walls of school laboratory by using a lens:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Which type of lens should he use and why?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) At what distance in terms of focal length &#8216;F&#8217; of the lens should he place the candle flame so as to get (i) a magnified, and (ii) a diminished image respectively ou the wall?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Draw ray diagram to show the formation of the image in each case.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) A convex lens should be used. This is because it can produce a real image of the<br />
candle flame on the wall as it is a converging lens where refracted rays actually meet. (b) &amp; (c) (i) A real magnified image is formed when the candle flame is placed between F and 2F from the convex lens on the other side of the wall.<br />

<p><strong>Question.23. (a) List three common Refractive defects of vision. Suggest the way of correcting these defects.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) About 45 lac people in the developing countries are suffering from corneal blindness. About 30 lac children below the age of 12 years suffering from this defect can be cured by replacing the defective cornea with the cornea of a donated eye. How and why can students of your age involve themselves to create awareness about this fact among people?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) The three defects of vision:<br />
1. Myopia. Myopia is the defect of the eye vision due to which a person can see the near objects clearly, but he can not see the far objects clearly.<br />
Causes of myopia. Myopia is caused due to the elongation of the eye ball and due to decrease in the focal length of the eye lens. The eye lens becomes more convergent. Myopia can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable focal length in the spectacles of such a person.<br />
Diagram. See Q. 17, 2011 (I Outside Delhi).<br />
2. Long-sightedness or hypermetropia. Due to this defect, a person is not able to see the nearby objects clearly but can see the distant objects clearly.<br />
Causes of hypermetropia. It is caused due to the following reasons:<br />
(i) Normal increase in the focal length of the eye lens. The lens becomes less convergent.<br />
(ii) Shortening of the eyeball size.<br />
Correction. Long sightedness can be corrected by using a convex lens of suitable focal length in the spectacles of such a person.<br />
When a convex lens of suitable power is placed in front of the hypermetropic eye then the diverging rays of light coming from the nearby object are first converged by this convex lens. Due to this, the convex lens forms a virtual image of the nearby object at a point near to the hypermetropic eve. Then the hypermetropic eye can easily focus the image formed by convex lens on the retina.<br />
Diagram. See Q. 17, 2011 (I Delhi).<br />
3. Presbyopia. The power of accommodation of the eye decreases with ageing. It occurs due to the gradual weakening of the ciliary muscles and decreasing flexibility of the crystalline lens. The near point of the eye increases with age. It may reach even 2 metres. This defect is called presbyopia.<br />
Causes of presbyopia. It is mainly caused due to the weakening of the ciliary muscles of the eyes. Such a person may suffer from myopia and hypermetropia. This defect is then corrected by using bifocal lenses of suitable focal lengths. The upper part of the lens is a concave lens for correcting myopia to see the distant objects clearly, while the lower part of the lens has a convex lens to correct the hypermetropia to see the nearby objects clearly.<br />
(b) We have seen advertisements in media persuading people for eye donation. If cornea of the eyes are removed within 6 hours of the death of a person, it can be transplanted to a person suffering from corneal blindness. There are more than 45 lakh cases of corneal blindness and unfortunately out of these a major portion is that of children aged below 12 years. If a person comes forward for eye donation, he can save two corneal blind persons by donating one eye to each.<br />
How exciting it feels to think that after one&#8217;s death, he/she can make two blind persons see this wonderful world! Therefore it is a must to promote such advertisements to encourage people and make them aware of this noble cause.</p>
<p><strong>Question.24. The position of three elements A, B and C in the Periodic Table are shown below:</strong><br />
<strong> <img src="https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5452/30446625411_718183c265_o.png" alt="cbse-previous-year-question-papers-class-10-science-sa2-delhi-2014-12" width="817" height="174" /></strong><br />
<strong> Giving reasons, explain the following:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Element A is a non-metal.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Atom of element C has a larger size than atom of element A.</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Element B has a valency of 1.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) Element A is a non-metal because it belongs to Group VII therefore it has 7 electrons<br />
in its outermost shell. It needs one electron to acquire nearest inert gas configuration ’ and form a monovalent -ve ion.<br />
(b) Atom of element C has a larger size than that of element A because C belongs to the 3rd period therefore it has three shells whereas A belongs to the 2nd period thus it has two shells.<br />
(c) Element B has a valency of 1 because it belongs to Group I and has one valence electron. To complete its outermost shell or to acquire nearest noble gas configuration it loses one electron and forms a monovalent + ve ion.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong> Charles Robert Darwin gave the theory of evolution in his famous book &#8220;The Origin of Species&#8221;.</p>
<ul>
<li>The theory of evolution proposed by Darwin is known as &#8220;The Theory of Natural Selection&#8221;.</li>
<li>This theory suggests that the best adapted organisms are selected by nature to pass on their characteristics to the next generation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question.3. &#8220;We need to manage our resources.&#8221; List two reasons to justify this statement.</strong><br />

<p><strong>Question.6. List two environment friendly practices or habits which need to be followed by every member of a family/community. Explain how these practices will support the &#8220;Save the Environment&#8221; mission.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Two environment friendly practices to help save the environment are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Disposal of wastes after separating them into biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste material.</li>
<li>Use of unleaded petrol and alternate sources of energy, keeping the car engines properly tuned and serviced and types inflated to the right pressure, so that the vehicle runs smoothly.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.7. Explain with help of a labelled diagram, the cause of twinkling of stars.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Twinkling of Stars. The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of star light. The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index. Since the atmosphere bends star light &#8211; towards the normal, the apparent position of the star is slightly different from the actual position. This apparent position of the star is not stationary, but keeps on changing slightly as the physical conditions of the earth&#8217;s atmosphere are not stationary.<br />
Since the stars are very distant, they act as point-sized sources of light. As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly, the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of light entering the eye flickers—the star sometimes appears brighter and at other times appears fainter, which is the twinkling effect.<br />

<p><strong>Question.11. What are esters? How are they prepared? List two uses of esters.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Esters are usually volatile liquids having pleasant smell (in fruity smell).<br />
Preparation. When carboxylic acid reacts with an alcohol in the presence of a little concentrated sulphuric acid, it gives a pleasant smelling ester.<br />
For example. When ethanoic acid is warmed with ethanol in the presence of a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid, a sweet smelling ester called ethyl ethanoate is formed.<br />
