<p><strong>Question.13. &#8216;Consumption of energy in all forms has been rising all over the country. There is an urgent need to develop a sustainable path of energy development and energy saving.&#8217; Suggest and explain any three measures to solve this binning problem.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Every sector of the national economy—agriculture, industry, transport, (commercial and domestic), needs greater inputs of energy.<br />
With increasing population and changing lifestyles energy consumption is increasing very fast. We are not self sufficient in energy according to demands.

Three measures to reduce consumption of energy in all forms:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can do our bit by using public transport systems instead of individual vehicles.</li>
<li>Switching off electricity when not in use.</li>

<p><strong>Question.25. &#8220;Democracy stands much superior in promoting dignity and freedom of the citizens&#8221;. Justify the statement.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Examples to illustrate that dignity and freedom of citizens are best guaranteed in a democracy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dignity of women. Democracy recognises dignity of women as a necessary ingredient of society. The one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is’+o have more women as elected representatives. To achieve this, it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies. Panchayati Raj in India has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women. In March 2010, the Women&#8217;s Reservation Bill was passed in the Rajya Sabha ensuring 33% reservation for women in Parliament and State legislative bodies.</li>
<li> Democracy has strengthened the claims of disadvantaged and discriminated castes. When governments are formed, political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it. Some political parties are known to favour some castes. Democracy provides for equal status and opportunities for all castes.</li>
<li>Democracy transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen. A democracy is concerned with ensuring that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making that affects them all.</li>
<li>A citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making. There is transparency in a democracy like India. In October 2005, the Right to Information (RTI) law was passed which ensures all its citizens the right to get all the information about the functions of the government departments. In a democracy, people also have the right to complain about its functioning.</li>
