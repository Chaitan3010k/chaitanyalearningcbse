<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>QUESTIONS FROM TEXTBOOK SOLVED</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>READ AND FIND OUT</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q1. Who is Mr Lamb? How does Derry get into his garden?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Mr Lamb is an old man with a tin leg. His real leg was blown off years ago during the war. He lives all alone in his house. There is a garden near the house. It has ripe crab apples looking orange and golden in colour.<br />
Mr Lamb is sitting in his garden when Derry climbs over the garden wall to get into his garden. Though the gate is open, the boy does not use it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q2. Do you think all this will change Derry’s attitude towards Mr Lamb?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Mr Lamb learns from Derry that the latter does not like being near people. They stare at his face and feel afraid of him as half of it has been burnt by acid and looks very ugly. Mr Lamb offers him a new way bf thinking. He tells him about a person who was afraid of everything and locked himself in a room. A picture fell off the wall on his head and killed him. Derry finds that the old man says peculiar things. He is further surprised to learn about the old man’s habits. He loves to read book. His house has many books. There aren’t any curtains at the windows. He likes the light and the darkness. He keeps the windows open to hear the wind.<br />
Derry says that he too likes to hear the sound of rain on the roof. But he also hears people talking about him and his future. The old man tells him that he has all the God-given organs. He will get on the way he wants, like the rest. He could even get on better than them, if he made a firm decision. He tells Derry that hatred is worse than acid because it can bum man from inside. He should not worry about his burned face or what people say about it. All this brings a positive change in Derry’s attitude towards Mr Lamb. He promises to come back after informing his mother. He asks Mr Lamb about his life and friends and recognises his loneliness and disappointment. He keeps his promise and returns only to find Mr Lamb lying on the ground.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>READING WITH INSIGHT</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q1. What is it that draws Derry towards Mr Lamb in spite of himself?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Both Derry and Mr Lamb suffer from physical impairment. Derry has one side of his face disfigured and burnt by acid. The old man has a tin leg because his real leg got blown off during the war. Apart from these physical disabilities, Derry finds signs of loneliness and disappointment in Mr Lamb’s life. The old man tries to overcome these feelings but the sense of alienation felt by him is more painful than the pain caused by physical disability.<br />
Derry tries to avoid meeting people because they consider his face frightful and ugly. They avoid him as they are afraid of him. His parents seem worried about him and talk about him and his future.<br />
Mr Lamb provides him a new approach to things. He tells him to see, hear, feel and think about things around him. He should not hate others. Hatred is worse than acid because it bums the inside. He has all the God-given limbs. He must take a firm decision and work towards it. He will succeed. He should not be afraid of people and they will not be afraid of him. All these factors draw Derry towards Mr Lamb.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q2. In which section of the play does Mr Lamb display signs of loneliness and disappointment? What are the ways in which Mr Lamb tries to overcome these feelings?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> It is in the middle section of the first scene of the play that Mr Lamb displays signs of loneliness and disappointment. He says that when it is a bit cooler, he will get the ladder and a stick, and pull down those crab apples. He makes jelly. Derry could help him. Then he says he is interested in anybody or anything that God made. It may be a person, flower, fruit, grass, weeds or rubbish. There are plenty of things to look at. Some of them are his crab apples or the weeds or a spider climbing up a silken ladder or his tall sun-flowers. He also likes to talk and have a company. He has a hive of bees. He hears them singing. He sits in the sun and reads books. He likes the light and the darkness. He hears the wind coming through open windows. There aren’t any curtains at the windows as they either shut things out or shut things in. These are the ways in which Mr Lamb tries to overcome his loneliness.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q3. The actual pain or inconvenience caused by a physical impairment is often much less than the sense of alienation felt by the person with disabilities. What is the kind of behaviour that the person expects from others?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>The play ‘On The Face Of It’ focuses our attention on the physical pain and mental anguish of the persons suffering from some physical impairment. The playwright, Susan Hill, presents the two leading‘characters—an old man and a small boy—having different sorts of physical disabilities.<br />
The old man has a tin leg. It did hurt him when it came off. Then he got used to it. He feels pain now and then in wet weather. He finds it inconvenient to run, to climb a tree or a ladder. He lives all alone in a big house with a garden.<br />
The boy has one side of his face badly burnt by acid. He felt the physical pain then. After discharge from hospital, he feels hurt at the attitude of the people. They regard his face as horrible and ugly, show signs of being scared and avoid his presence. In short, he is disliked, if not hated. He is not accepted as an ordinary member of society. So, he does not like people to look at him.<br />
It is clear that the sense of alienation that these disabled persons feel causes them constant pain. Such persons expect kind and considerate behaviour from others. They do not want tears, sympathy or pity. They dislike being pointed at, nicknamed, mocked at or made a fun •: of. They only demand a reasonable bahaviour from others, full of appreciation of their difficulties.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q4. Will Derry get back to his old seclusion or will Mr Lamb’s brief association effect a change in the kind of life he will lead in the future?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> (Two different answers are possible. One is being given below)<br />
Derry will not get back to his old seclusion. He has been associated with Mr Lamb for a short time only, but even this brief association will effect a change in the kind of life he will lead in future. Instead of being conscious of what people comment about the ugliness of his face, he will use his head and heart to achieve what he decides to do in life. It is also possible that with his firm determination and zeal to achieve his aim, he might do better than the rest, even those who do not suffer from any physical impairment.<br />
By his persuasive manner and skilful use of anecdotes, Mr Lamb convinces Derry that a life of seclusion and withdrawal from the world is dull as well as risky. The world has many beautiful objects to see and admire, sounds to hear and ideas to think. One should have an open mind and positive attitude. Hatred is worse than acid.<br />
Derry’s mother tries her best to keep Derry with her. But Derry resolves to go back to Mr Lamb to look at things and listen to him. He no longer cares about his face. What he thinks and feels, and what he wants to see and find out and hear is more important. He does not want to remain at his home. He has got clear perception of things. If he does not go back there, he will never go anywhere in that world again. In short, Derry’s coming back to Mr Lamb is indicative of the change in the kind of fife he is likely to lead in future.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q1.“Mind the apples!”, says Mr Lamb. Why do you think, does he issue this instruction, to whom and how many times?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb issues this instruction to Derry, a boy of fourteen, who climbs over the garden wall and enters the garden. He asks Derry twice to mind the apples which have been blown down by the wind from the trees and strewn in the grass. He (Derry) could put his foot on some apple, fall down and hint himself.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q2. What is the attitude of Mr Lamb to the small boy who comes to his garden ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Mr Lamb’s attitude to the small boy is quite gentle, protective and accommodating. Like an elder in the family offering advice and instructions to the younger members, Mr Lamb advises the young boy to mind the apples lest he should trip. He also advises the boy not to feel afraid.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q3. What explanation does the small boy offer for coming into the garden? How does Mr Lamb react to it?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>The boy thought that this was an empty place. He did not know there was anybody there. Mr Lamb assures him that it is all right. He asks the boy what he is afraid of. He tells the boy that the house is empty as he is in the garden and is likely to stay there. Such a beautiful day should not be wasted indoors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q4. “T &#8216;m not afraid. People are afraid of me,” says Derry. What do people think on seeing his face? How do they react then?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> On looking at Derry’s face they find it bad and frightful. They think that it is the ugliest thing they have ever seen. They call him a poor boy as one side of his face has been burnt by acid. Some of them are afraid of his ugly and horrible face.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q5. How does Mr Lamb change the subject from ugly face to ripe apples?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> OR</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> How does Mr Lamb keep himself busy when it is a bit cooler ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>There is a momentary pause in the conversation. Then Mr Lamb changes the subject. He says that when it is a bit cooler, he will get the ladder and a stick. Then he will pull down those ripe crab apples. He makes jelly. He calls these orange coloured and golden apples magic fruit. September is a good time to make jelly. He tells the boy that he could help him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q6. Why, according to Derry, has the old man changed the subject?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry says that people always change the subject. They don’t ask him about his physical impairment. They simply pretend that it is not true and isn’t there. They don’t want the boy to mind and get upset. He thinks that the old man has changed the subject because he is afraid to ask him about his burnt face.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q7. “You got burned in a fire,” says Mr Lamb. What do you think, had happened to Derry’s face?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Derry’s face did not get burned in a fire. He got acid all down that side of his face and it burned it all away. Derry says that this acid not only ate his face up, it also ate him up. One side of his face is ugly and it won’t ever be any different.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q8. How does Mr Lamb react to Derry’s query: ‘Aren’t you interested’?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb tells Derry that he is interested in anybody and anything. There’s nothing God made that does not interest him. Fruit and flowers, trees and herbs, grass and weeds all interest him. Even stuff or rubbish is interesting. He finds no essential difference between a “weed’ and another ‘flower’ as both represent life—developing or growing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q9. “We&#8217;re not the same”, says Derry. How does Mr Lamb try to convince him that there is no essential difference between them?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry and Mr Lamb are both of the same species. They represent various stages of growth. Derry is young, Mr Lamb is old. Both suffer from the same physical impairment. Derry has a burnt face. The old man has got a tin leg. But this physical disability is not important. What is important is that both are alive. Derry is standing there whereas Mr Lamb is sitting.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q10. How, according to Derry, does the tin leg not trouble Mr Lamb? What explanation does the old man offer?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry thinks that the old man can put on trousers and cover up his tin leg. Then no one sees it. So, people don’t have to notice and stare at, as they do at his face. Mr Lamb replies that some people do notice and stare at his disability. Some don’t. In the end, they get tired of it. Moreover, there are plenty of things to stare at.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q11.“There’s plenty of other things to stare at.” Which ‘things’ are worth staring at and why?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>According to the old man there are plenty of things to stare at. These include crab apples or the weeds or a spider climbing up a silken ladder, or his tall sun-flowers. All of them are beautiful and ‘growing’. Derry is surprised at the mention of ‘things’. Mr Lamb tries to convince him that it is all relative. Then he mentions ‘Beauty and the Beast’.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q12. How does Derry interpret the fairy stoiy ‘Beauty and the Beast’? What does he feel about himself?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry says that he has been told that story before. It teaches us that outward appearance does not matter. It is what one is inside that is important. Handsome is that handsome does. Beauty loved the monstrous beast for himself. When she kissed him, he changed into a handsome prince. No one except Derry’s mother kisses him. She too kisses him on the other side of the face. He has developed a negative attitude and says he does not care ’ “if nobody ever kissed” him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q13. How, according to Derry, do people try to console those suffering from some physical impairment?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> They ask the person to look at all those people who are in pain and brave. They never cry or complain. They don’t feel sorry for themselves. Then the person is asked to think of all<br />
those persons worse off than him. One might have been blinded or bom deaf, or confined to a wheelchair, or be crazy and dribble. Since Derry has none of these disabilities he is far better placed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q14. Why do these arguments fail to console Derry ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Derry has developed negative attitude. He says that the arguments to console him will not make his face change. He feels more hurt and pained by the comments of persons or what he overhears. Once he heard a woman in the street whispering to another, “Look at that, that’s a terrible thing. That’s a face only a mother could love.” Derry calls it cruel of them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q15. How does Mr Lamb try to remove the baseless fears of Derry&#8217;?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Derry has developed withdrawal symptoms. He doesn’t like being near people. Mr Lamb tells him the story of a person who was afraid of everything in the world. So he went into his room and locked the door. He got into his bed and stayed there for a while. Then a picture fell off the wall on to his head and killed him.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q16. Which fears did the man suffer from? What is the common factor in all of them?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> The man feared that a bus might run him over, or a man might breathe deadly germs onto him, or a donkey might kick him to death or lightning might strike him down, or he might love a girl and the girl would leave him, and he might slip on a banana skin and fall and people who saw him would laugh their heads off. Most of these fears are imaginary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q17. What peculiar things does Derry notice about the old man?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry thinks that the old man is peculiar. He says peculiar things. He asks questions which Derry does not understand. There are no curtains at the windows in his house. He likes the light and darkness and hears the wind with the windows open.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q18. What does Derry listen about himself? How does he react to it?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry listens to what his parents talk about him downstairs when he is not there. They seem to be anxious about him and his future. What he will ever do and how will he ever get on in that world. What is going to happen to him with that bum mark on his face. They say what is going to happen to him when they have died.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q19. In what ways does Mr Lamb inspire Derry to overcome his physical disability?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb tells Derry that he &#8216;has got two arms, two legs and eyes and ears. He has got a tongue and a brain. He will get on the way he wants, like all the rest. And if he chooses and sets his mind to it, he could get on even better than all the rest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q20. “People are never just nothing. Never.” Why does Mr Lamb say so? Why does he advise Derry not to hate anyone?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb says that he has friends every where. Derry says that the people passing us in the street are not our friends. Mr Lamb tells him that they are not enemies either. When Derry says they are “Just nothing”, Mr Lamb makes this remark. He tells Derrry that hatred does more harm than any bottle of acid. Acid only bums the face, but hatred may bum a person away inside.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q21. How should people be judged?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>People should not be judged by what they look like. They must be judged by their actions. Appearances may be deceptive. On the other hand, people with physical impairments overcome their disabilities and perform wonderful feats in different spheres.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q22. How, according to Mr Lamb, can one overcome of sense of hurt or humiliation caused by remarks at one’s physical disability?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Mr Lamb does not provide a straight forward solution. He says that in the street kids shout “Lamey-Lamb” at him. Still they come to his garden. They are not afraid of him because he is not afraid of them. He simply ignores their comments. He concentrates on other things which are encouraging and positive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q23. What possibility does Derry indicate in the old man’s act of getting the crab apples down? What is its dramatic importance?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry says that if the old man fell down the ladder and broke his neck, he might lie on the grass and die, in case he was alone in the garden. This observation proves prophetic. The last scene shows the ladder falling back with Mr Lamb. The playwright uses the device of foreshadowing to prepare us for the eventual end.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q24. What does Deny want to know? How, according to the old man, can he know that?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry wants to know what he could do. The old man tells him that he does not know everything. He can’t tell the boy what to do. He has to find it out himself by waiting, watching, listening sitting here or going there. Derry says that he wants something no one else has got or ever will be. Something just his own.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q25. What makes Derry think that the old man is always alone and miserable? What does he tell the old man? </strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Derry asks Mr Lamb whether the persons who come there talk to him and ask him things. As usual, Mr Lamb says that some do, some don’t. He asks them as he likes to learn. This makes Derry think that nobody ever comes there.<br />
He tells the old man that he is there all alone by himself and miserable. He says no one would know if he were alive or dead and nobody cares.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q26. Why does Derry’s mother oppose his going back to the old man’s garden?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry’s mother tells him that she has heard things about the old man. In fact, she has been warned. Though they have lived there for three months, she knows what is worth knowing and Derry is not to go back there.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q27. What argument does Derry give to convince his mother why he wants to go to the old man’s garden?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans. </strong></span>Derry says that the old m^n has a tin leg. He lives in a huge house without curtains. He has a garden. Derry wants to be there and listen to things that matter. Things nobody else has ever said. Things he wants to think about. They are not about his face and how he looks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q28.What makes Derry resolve to go to the old man?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span>He no longer cares about his face and looks. He is more concerned with what he thinks and feels, what he wants to see and find out and hear. He knows that if he does not go back there, he will never go anywhere in that world again. He wants the world. He no longer shuns it or avoids the people.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q29. Comment on the ending of the play ‘On The Face Of If.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span>The play has a pathetic but dramatic ending. Mr Lamb who works actively in spite of his physical disability loses balance and falls down along with the ladder. Derry enters and tries to converse with Mr Lamb, who does not respond. Mr Lamb’s “exit” is exactly the same as envisaged by Derry earlier in the play.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q30.What other ending would you suggest to the above story ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span>I would like the play to end on a happy note. Derry’s efforts will revive the old man. After regaining his consciousness, Mr Lamb will grant permission to Derry to live with him and see, hear and learn things.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q1. How does Derry behave on entering Mr Lamb’s garden?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Derry does not use the gate to enter the garden. He climbs over the garden wall. His footsteps are heard as he walks slowly and hesitantly through the long grass. He is startled when Mr Lamb asks him to mind the apples and warns that he might trip. Deny shows signs of fear and nervousness. He explains that he took it for an empty place. Mr Lamb, the old man, tells him that the house is empty till he goes inside. That beautiful day is not to be spent inside. Derry panics and says he has got to go. He becomes angry to learn that the old man was watching him. He explains his intentions. He has not come there to steal anything. When Mr Lamb again asks him not to be afraid, Derry remarks that people are afraid of him because his face is ugly and frightful.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q2. What efforts does Mr Lamb make to strike up a friendship with Derry, the small boy, who enters his garden ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb is quite gentle, accommodating and protective. He asks Derry to mind the apples as he might trip. Instead of feeling angry over the way of his entry, he points out that the gate is always open and he is welcome. His cordial manner and conciliatory tone touch the inner most chords of a defiant boy like Derry who does not want to mix up with others. On learning about his burnt face, he does not react like others. Instead of exhibit¬ing fear and revulsion, he shows understanding and affection. He admits that he is the same as the boy. If the boy has a burnt face, he has got a tin leg. Gradually, he tries to win over the confidence of Derry by reminding him of ‘Beauty and the Beast’. He then tells him the story of a man who feared everything and shut himself in a room. His positive attitude towards life inspires the boy to talk to him like a friend.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q3. What is the bond that unites the two—old Mr Lamb and Derry, the small boy ? How does the old man inspire the small boy?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> It is the bond of physical impairment that unites old Mr Lamb and the small boy, Derry. He got his leg blown off during the war and since then he has a tin leg. Derry got one side of his face burnt by acid. Their respective disabilities have not only caused pain and suffer¬ing to the body but to their mind and soul as well. They have to live with their physical impairment. Mr Lamb has adjusted himself to the ways of the world and stopped bother¬ing about what people call him. He keeps himself busy in meaningful activities like pick¬ing apples, making jelly, bee-keeping and preparing toffee from honey. He loves reading books, hearing music, observing beautiful things and thinking about them. He inspires the small boy by saying that he has all the God-given organs intact. He has to decide what to do. He must work for it and then he can outshine even the others. Derry admits that ‘Handsome is he who handsome does.’ For him his face or how he looks does not matter now. He has become positive and has started thinking differently.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q4. What is the theme of the play ‘On The Face Of It’? How has it been worked out?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> The theme of the play is the consequences of physical impairment on the affected person’s body, mind and soul. The actual pain and inconvenience caused by the disabilities is often much less than the sense of alienation felt by the disabled person. People think that a person who has lost an organ or suffered some deformity such as a disfigured face should either be confined to the hospital or allowed to move in the company of people having the same disability. The playwright does not approve of this idea as it will create a strange sort of world. The attitude of persons towards the victims of accidents or disasters needs com¬plete change. They must be considerate and thoughtful. They must appreciate the efforts of the physically challenged persons to overcome their disability and compete with others. The theme has been worked out through the interaction of two characters—old Mr Lamb and a young boy, Derry. Through his peculiar way of looking at things and asking ques¬tions, Mr Lamb persuades Derry to have a positive approach to fife. Only positive attitude towards life will give one true happiness.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q5. Compare and contrast the characters of Mr. Lamb and Derry.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong> </span>Both Mr. Lamb and the young boy Derry have one thing in common—their physical im¬pairment. Both are victims of these disabilities after birth. The leg of Mr. Lamb was blown off during the war. Derry’s face was burnt by acid. One side of his face looked very ugly and frightful.<br />
Apart from this, they have nothing in common. Mr. Lamb is old, Derry is a young boy of fourteen. Mr. Lamb enjoys company and wants to talk. Derry is very withdrawn and defiant. He does not want to come in contact with people.<br />
Mr Lamb does not bother about his lameness. He has developed love for reading books, hearing music, seeing beautiful things and thinking about them. He is calm and patient. He asks peculiar questions. He forces Derry to see that actions are more important than mere looks. In spite of his lameness he picks apples, makes jelly, maintains a beehive and makes toffees from honey. The gate of his garden is always open. Derry develops a new vision of life under his guidance. He becomes positive and looks happy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q6. What impression do you form of Derry, the small boy, in the play ‘On The Face Of It’ ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Derry is a fourteen year old boy who is very withdrawn and defiant. One side of his face has been burnt by acid and it looks very ugly and frightful. This incident has made him a victim of inferiority complex.<br />
Derry is highly sensitive to what others—his parents, family friends, well-wishers or even total strangerssay about him. Their anxiety, concern, fear and revulsion pains him more than the bum did.<br />
Derry is quite intelligent. When Mr Lamb mentions the story ‘Beauty and the Beast’, Derry at once comes out with its moral: ‘Handsome is as handsome does.’ He, however, evokes self-pity by saying, “I won’t change&#8230; and no one’ll kiss me ever.”<br />
Derry is sensitive to the sufferings of others. He arouses sympathy for himself by making enquiries about the old man’s leg, pain and how he passes his life alone. Derry has the capacity to learn. He is impressed by the old man’s way of life in spite of physical handicap. In the end, he does not bother about his face or looks and wants to see, hear, learn and think and do what no one else has done. In short, Derry is a developing character.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q7. Which qualities of Mr Lamb have impressed you most?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> OR</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Draw a character sketch of old Mr Lamb.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Mr Lamb is the protagonist in the play. He dominates the play from beginning to end. He impresses us as a sensitive, watchful, kind, considerate and sympathetic person. He is quite gentle, accommodating and protective. He is more concerned about the boy’s well-being than the apples.<br />
He is a victim of alienation due to his physical impairment. Though he keeps his gates open and says he has many friends, actually he lives alone and is quite miserable. He loves company and wants to talk. He shares his thoughts even with the young boy.<br />
Mr Lamb is like a modem communicator and a psychologist who believes in drawing out the best of an individual. His tactful handling and peculiar questions make Derry shed some of his firmly fixed notions and respond to the things of the world around him. Thus he is a source of inspiration to the depressed and gloomy.<br />
Mr Lamb is pragmatic. His way of life is an object lesson for all who suffer some physical handicap or the other. One can always undertake some meaningful activities which give life some purpose and aim and save it from boredom. Even in his fall with the ladder, he exhibits Christ-like grace.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q8. Comment on the ending of the play ‘On The Face Of It’. How far do you find it effective ?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> The ending of the play is quite suggestive. Mr Lamb, who has been picking apples, falls down along with the ladder. As Derry enters the garden, he finds total silence pervading there. He is surprised and shocked to see Mr Lamb on the ground. He hopes it is all right. He kneels near Mr Lamb and announces that he has come back and he is there. He implores the old man to get up and talk. As the old man does not respond to Derry’s repeated requests, he begins to weep.<br />
The ending is quite dramatic and stageworthy. The old man with the ladder under him is a Christ-like figure. It is a pathetic ending, no doubt, but it does not spread gloom. Rather, it acts like a beacon light. The old generation has handed over the charge to the younger one. It is like a soldier making an exit with the satisfaction of mission accomplished. The old man has handed over his philosophy of life to Derry and inspired him to find out what he wants to be. Thus, though the old man expires physically, his ideas inspire Derry to pursue higher goals and Achieve them. In this sense, the ending is quite effective and meaningful.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q9. What do you understand by ‘On The Face Of If ? Do you think the title ‘On the Face of If is appropriate? Give reasons in support of your answer.</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> ‘On The Face Of It’ is used to say that something seems to be good, true, etc. but that this opinion may need to be changed when you know more about it.<br />
Apparently, the play seems to be an interaction between two persons suffering from physi¬cal impairment. Being a drama of ideas, it has minimum physical action. The old man’s efforts to strike up a friendship with a young boy of fourteen, who is very withdrawn and defiant, seems to be the main issue. The old man’s effort is worth appreciation.<br />
However, as we go on reading further, more is in store for us. We learn the mental anguish, emotional starvation and physical distress of the physically challenged who are unable to lead normal life among normal persons. The play is not didactic but it inspires people like Derry, who have some physical blemish, to ignore it as well as comments of people about it. They should set goals for themselves and strive to outshine even the other normal persons. Thus, the title is quite appropriate and highly suggestive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>Q10. Both Derry and Lamb are physically impaired and lonely. It is the responsibility of society to understand and support people with infirmities so that they do not suffer from a sense of alienation. As a responsible citizen, write, in about 100 words what you would do to bring about a change in the lives of such people. [All India 2014]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Ans.</strong></span> Both Mr. Lamb and the young boy Derry have one thing in common—they are physically impaired. Both are victims of these disabilities after birth. Such type of people should not be reprimanded but they must be honoured with. They must be given respect and honour in the society. If somebody looks upon them with pessimistic approach, they may never be able to come out of their sorrow. But they will go into the world of alienation. As a responsible citizen, it must be our duty to provide them a respectable place in the society. Then only they can come into the mainstream of the society and live like a normal people. They must not be reminded of their disabilities. Only then we can play the role of a responsible citizen.<br />
