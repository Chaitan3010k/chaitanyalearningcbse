<h4>Electric Charges and Fields Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Which orientation of an electric dipole in a uniform electric field would correspond to stable equilibrium ? (All India 2008)<br />
Answer:<br />
When dipole moment vector is parallel to electric field vector<br />
\(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{P}} \| \overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\)</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
If the radius of the Gaussian surface enclosing a charge is halved, how does the electric flux through the Gaussian surface change ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Electic flux ϕ<sub>E</sub> is given by<br />
\(\phi_{\mathrm{E}}=\oint \overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}} \cdot d \vec{s}=\frac{\mathrm{Q}}{\varepsilon_{0}}\)<br />
&#8230;. where [Q is total charge inside the closed surface<br />
∴ On changing the radius of sphere, the electric flux through the Gaussian surface remains same.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Define the term electric dipole moment of a dipole. State its S.I. unit<br />
Answer:<br />
τ = OE sin θ<br />
If E = 1 unit, θ = 90°, then τ = P<br />
Dipole moment may be defined as the torque acting on an electric dipole, placed perpendicular to a uniform electric dipole, placed perpendicular to a uniform electric field of unit strength.<br />
or Strength of electric dipole is called dipole moment.<br />
\(|\overrightarrow{\mathrm{P}}|=q|2 a|\)<br />
∴ SI unit is Cm.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
In which orientation, a dipole placed in a uniform electric field is in</p>
<ul>
<li>stable,</li>
<li>unstable equilibrium ? (Delhi 2010)</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>For stable equilibrium, a dipole is placed parallel to the electric field.</li>
<li>For unstable equilibrium, a dipole is placed antiparallel to the electric field.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Figure shows three point charges, +2q, -q and + 3q. Two charges +2q and -q are enclosed within a surface &#8216;S&#8217;. What is the electric flux due to this configuration through the surface &#8216;S&#8217; (Delhi 2010)<br />

distance &#8216;d&#8217; apart as shown in the figure. The electric field intensity is zero at a point ’P&#8217; on the line joining them as shown. Write two conclusions that you can draw from this. (Comptt. Delhi 2014)<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two point charges ‘ q<sub>1</sub>&#8216; and &#8216; q<sub>2</sub> should be of opposite nature.</li>
<li>Magnitude of charge ql must be greater than that of charge q<sub>2</sub>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 22. What is the electric flux through a cube of side 1 cm which encloses an electric dipole? (Delhi 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
Zero because the net charge of an electric dipole (+ q and &#8211; q) is zero.</p>
<p>Question 23.<br />
Why are electric field lines perpendicular at a point on an equipotential surface of a conductor? (Comptt. All India 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
If the electric field lines were not normal to the equipotential surface, it would have a non-zero component along the surface. To move a unit test charge against the direction of the component of the field, work would have to be done which means this surface cannot be equipotential surface.<br />
Hence, electric field lines are perpendicular at a point on an equipotential surface of a conductor.</p>

Answer:<br />
Consider an electric dipole consisting of charges + q and &#8211; q and of length 2a placed in a uniform electric field \(\overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\) making an angle θ with it. It has a dipole moment of magnitude,<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116589" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-1-Electric-Charges-and-Fields-Class-12-Important-Questions-14.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 1 Electric Charges and Fields Class 12 Important Questions 14" width="329" height="357" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-1-Electric-Charges-and-Fields-Class-12-Important-Questions-14.png 329w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-1-Electric-Charges-and-Fields-Class-12-Important-Questions-14-276x300.png 276w" sizes="(max-width: 329px) 100vw, 329px" /><br />
Hence the net translating force on a dipole in a uniform electric field is zero. But the two equal and opposite forces act at different points of the dipole. They form a couple which exerts a torque.<br />
Torque = Either force × Perpendicular distance between the two forces<br />
x = qE × 2a sin θ<br />
X = pE sin θ [ ∵ p = q × 2a; p is dipole moment]<br />
As the direction of torque \(\vec{\tau}\) is perpendicular to \(\vec{p}\) and \(\vec{E}\), so we can write \(\vec{\tau}=\vec{p} \times \overrightarrow{\mathrm{E}}\)</p>
<p>Question 31.<br />

A charge q is enclosed by a spherical surface of radius R. If the radius is reduced to half, how would the electric flux through the surface change? (All India 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
Electric flux over an area in an electric field is the total number of lines of force passing through the area. It is represented by ϕ . It is a scalar quantity. Its S.I unit is Nm<sup>2</sup> C<sup>-1</sup> or Vm.<br />

<p>Since the field is everywhere radial, flux through the two ends of the cylindrical Gaussian surface is zero. At the cylindrical part of the surface, E is normal to the surface at every point, and its magnitude is constant, since it depends only on r. The surface area of the curved part is 2πrl, where l is the length of the cylinder.</p>

[The direction of \(\vec{\tau} \) is given by right hand screw rule and is normal to \(\vec{p} \)  ] and \(\vec{E} \)<br />
Special cases<br />
(i) when θ = 0 then τ = PE sin θ = 0<br />
∴ Torque is zero and the dipole is in stable equilibrium<br />
(ii) When θ = 90 then τ = PE sin 90 = PE<br />
∴ The Torque is maximum<br />
(b) Ratio of flux<br />

<p>Question 71.<br />
(a) Define electric flux. Write its S.I. unit. &#8220;Gauss&#8217;s law in electrostatics is true for any closed surface, no matter what its shape or size is&#8221;. Justify this statement with the help of a suitable example.<br />
(b) Use Gauss&#8217;s law to prove that the electric field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero. (All India)<br />
(a) Electric flux. The electric lines of force passing through that area, when held normally to the lines of force.<br />
Answer:<br />
Electric flux. The electric lines of force passing through that area, when held normally to the lines of force.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116656" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-1-Electric-Charges-and-Fields-Class-12-Important-Questions-81.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 1 Electric Charges and Fields Class 12 Important Questions 81" width="232" height="47" /><br />
S.I. units: Vm, Nm<sup>2</sup>C<sup>-1</sup><br />
Gauss&#8217;s Law states that the electric flux through a closed surface is given by<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-116657" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-1-Electric-Charges-and-Fields-Class-12-Important-Questions-82.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 1 Electric Charges and Fields Class 12 Important Questions 82" width="76" height="44" /><br />
The law implies that the total electric flux through a closed surface depends on the quantity of total charge enclosed by the surface, and does not depend on its shape and size.</p>
<p>For example, net charge enclosed by the electric dipole (q, -q) is zero, hence the total elec¬tric flux enclosed by a surface containing electric dipole is zero.<br />
(b) Electrical field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell. Let us consider a point &#8216;P&#8217; inside the shell. The Gaussian surface is a sphere through P centred at O.</p>
<p>The flux through the Gaussian surface is E × 4πr<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>However, in this case, the Gaussian surface encloses no charge. Gauss&#8217;s law then gives<br />
E × 4πr<sup>2</sup> = 0<br />
or E = 0<br />
(r &lt; R)<br />
that is, the field due to a uniformly charged thin shell is zero at all points inside the shell.<br />
