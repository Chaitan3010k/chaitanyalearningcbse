He was already a ‘hard-charging’ zone sales manager for a chemical company. He was a man of highly competitive nature and always had a big genuine grin of satisfaction over his face. He was a favoured youngman liked by all. Everything was going well for him.</p>
<p>(b)</p>
<ul>
<li>They were men from Hooper’s chemical company. After the fifth week of the accident, some men from his company came to the hospital and told Hooper to take a year off</li>
<li>Hooper’s company told him to take a year off. They also promised to create a desk job for him at headquarters. A man in a wheelchair with paralysed arm and leg couldn’t do the mobile job of a ‘hard- charging’ zone sales manager. Hence, a desk job was especially created for him at headquarters.</li>
</ul>
<p>(c) Duke was a four year old Dobermann pinscher weighing 23 kilos. Chuck Hooper liked Duke for his energy and cheerfulness. Duke knew what he had to do for Hooper.<br />
Once while jumping he hit Hooper about the belt, causing him to fight to keep his balance. He never jumped on Chuck Hooper again. With Hooper standing, the dog walked to the end of the leash and tugged steadily. Leaning against the pull, Hooper learned to keep his balance. In this way, Duke helped Hooper to go on for short walks.</p>
<p>(d) Chuck’s company had created a especial desk job for him. But when he returned to the company’s headquarters, this move created some problems. Chuck was fighting very hard for his come back. The people there didn’t know that Hooper had already set his next objective: ‘March 1, a full day’s work’. But no one dared to tell him that he couldn’t do justice to his job as a salesman. He couldn’t move properly and worked only an hour a day.</p>
<p>(e) Charles Hooper was finally appointed Assistant National Sales Manager. Hooper’s appointment letter was so worded as if it was a special tribute to Duke. The words were “&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. therefore, to advance our objectives step by step, &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..” It was just ‘step by step’ that Hooper learnt to maintain his balance and go for short walks. Duke made Hooper walk again like a normal man only ‘step by step’.</p>

<p><strong>Writing Task</strong><br />
Question 9.<br />
Read the diary entry written by Charles Hooper on the day he received the order, Charles Hooper is appointed Assistant National Sales Manager.”<br />
March 1, 19&#8230; Thursday 10 pm<br />
Last four years have been eventful. The day I brought Duke home&#8230; (Marcy was almost impolite to him because she would have preferred a Pomeranian to a Doberman)&#8230; to a stage on October 12, 1957 (when she would not allow anyone else to carry the injured Duke to the vet)&#8230; much water has flowed under the bridge. From being a very fit high-charging zone sales manager, I was reduced to a paralysed cripple forced to lie on a bed alone with my thoughts due to a small error by a car driver. Despair had led me on to helplessness&#8230; Was I to be a vegetable for the rest of my life ? I never wanted to be a burden on Marcy.</p>
<p>Duke’s re-entry into my life lifted my numb spirits. The day he made me take my first step, there was a rekindled hope. Duke assumed all the responsibility for leading me back to my office desk&#8230; Life had taken a full circle. From shock to denial and helplessness to anger, Duke taught me to cope with the challenge and led me to accept the changed mode of life. I am happy to be living as well as working successfully.</p>
<p>The order that I have received today is my tribute to Duke who would always be alive with me and be a part of everything else I achieve in my life.</p>
<p>When a person loses something, he is shocked and gets into a state of denial leading to anger. In such a situation coping well leads to acceptance and a changed way of living in view of the loss. Taking clues from what happened or might have happened with Hooper, write your views in the form of an article about&#8217; ‘Coping with Loss’ in 150-175 words.<br />
Answer:<br />
Coping With Loss<br />
Gain and Loss are the two facets of the same coin human life. Loss is inevitable at one time or the other in life. A man’s real courage, perseverance or endurance are tested only when a person loses something. The strong and the brave accept the loss. They say what can’t be cured must be endured. The weak lose their balance of mind and behaviour when they lose something. They lose their nerves to deal with such a thankless and unhappy position. The result is disastrous. They are shocked. They get into a state of denial leading to anger. They withdraw themselves. They are alienated from the mainstream of life. Coping well with such a situation leads to acceptance. And the acceptance leads to a changed way of living in view‘of the loss.</p>
<p>The protagonist of the story ‘A Dog Named Duke’ Hooper was a very dynamic, healthy and successful man before he met with a terrible accident. The accident reduces him to a paralysed cripple. He is forced to lie on bed. Despair leads him to helplessness. But Duke’s entry lifts his numb spirits. He decides to cope with the loss and accepts the reality. He moves to a changed way of life. The day he makes his first step, it rekindles hope in him. He accepts a desk job at the headquarters. But life must go on. So, he declares that he will start doing a full day’s work from March 1. He does succeed. His long patience, endurance and the ability to cope with the loss is rewarded. He is appointed Assistant National Sales Manager of his company.</p>

In such a situation, coping well leads to acceptance and a changed way of living in view of the loss. Taking clues from what happened or might have happened to Hooper, write your views on &#8216;Coping with Losses&#8217;.  <strong>(Value Based Question) (Board Term 12012, Set 54)</strong><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:<br />
</strong></span>Loss is an inevitable part of life. During our lifetime we experience a variety of losses like the death of a beloved, loss of job financial security, or a relationship breakup. With loss comes grief. It is a very stressful phase of life. It can very quickly deplete your energy and emotional reserves. The most important thing is not let your grief control your life. Support of someone is very essential to combat grief.<br />
Chuck had everything going for him—a job, house and family but an accident robbed him of the ability to talk and move. He was then hit by pain and grief and felt depressed. Duke, his Doberman proved to be a Saviour in his life. He rekindled a hope in the family and taught him to cope with the challenge successfully. He not only conquered his handicap with Duke&#8217;s assistance and regained his job but was also promoted as the Assistant National Sales Manager.<br />
We should take inspiration from his life and should remain firm and strong in challenging adversities,</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 10:<br />

You are happy that he has been promoted to the post of Assistant National Sales Manager.

Dear Julien,<br />
Hope you are in best of spirits.<br />
I am heartbroken at the sudden death of Duke. His death is a great loss for my family. How can I forget what he has done for our family.Chuck is well settled today and living a normal life but this happiness is a gift from Duke. We owe everything to Duke.<br />
The credit of Chuck&#8217;s recovery undoubtedly goes to Duke but his firm determination and iron willpower have also helped him to fight against all odds. The way Chuck regained his balance is by no means a Joke. I have seen the intelligent handling of Duke and the unconditional faith and trust in between the two. I am happy that he has been promoted to the post of Assistant National Sales Manager. He is doing well but I feel sad as Duke is no more. His positive attitude, patience and faith in Duke has helped him overcome the adverse circumstances and reach such heights. We owe our happiness to the extraordinary dog, Duke.<br />
Do write soon.<br />
Truly yours,<br />
Marcy</p>

Dear Diary<br />
After the car accident, I was completely bed-ridden due to the paralytic stroke on my left side, I was left alone in the house and missed company. 1 was then hit by pain and grief and felt depressed and lost. It was at this crucial juncture that Duke, my Doberman came as an angel in my life. He is responsible for getting me back on my feet. He assumed all the responsibility to make me stand on my feet. His sincerity, confidence and dedication brought me out of the deep, distressing water.I not only got my job back, but was also promoted.<br />
On 13 October 1957, Duke met with a fatal end. Little did I realize that I would lose him forever in an accident. His death has left a void in my life. My promotion to Assistant National Sales Manager is a special tribute to Duke. I owe a great deal to Duke, his devotion and dedication.My life itself is a gift from him. I am forever grateful to him and owe my success to him<br />
Good night diary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 12:<br />
</strong></span>Marcy was not fond of dogs and more so of big dogs. Yet when Duke died, she was devastated. After many days, she was able to pen down her feelings in her diary. Write a page of Marcy&#8217;s diary.   <strong>(Board Term 12010, Set Cl)</strong><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:<br />
</strong></span>Dear Diary,<br />
It has been a month since we buried Duke. Tears well up in my eyes, at the thought of his loss. People whom I have not met for two years might feel surprised at the change that has come in my attitude. Oh! how I hated that huge dog when Chuck brought him home, he seemed to take so much place and expected everyone to pamper him. Somehow I feel that Duke knew that I didn&#8217;t like him, so he remained out of my way. He was so much Chuck&#8217;s dog that he would follow him like a shadow. That fareful accident changed my life for better or worse. My first instinct as to put Duke into a kennel as the thought or looking after him in the absence of Chuck was unthinkable. I finally got him home after much pressure from all quarters. Chuck who was slowly going into depression didn&#8217;t really care at that time, A chance touch at the collar of Duke charged him up. It was as if Duke had become the instructor and Chuck the student. I saw the silent understanding, I saw the intelligent handling, I saw the unconditional faith and trust in each other. Gradually, I realized how ignorant I had been, how I had missed the opportunity to befriend this lovely creature who was ready in attendance. The way he helped Chuck regain his balance is by no means joke. The last two years of his life, Duke devotedly served his master. I am amazed at the change that has come over me. My tolerance level for big dogs has increased. I was heart broken at his sudden death. If only I had shown him my love before, but man cannot turn put the clock back.<br />
