<p><strong>1.Describe an activity to show that the magnetic field lines produced when current is passed through the circular coil.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
<strong>Aim :</strong> To study the characteristics of magnetic field produced by a current carrying circular coil at its centre.<br />
<strong>Apparatus Required :</strong> Rectangular cardboard having two holes, Thick copper circular coils of different radii having known number of turns, key, battery, rheostat, stand, iron filings.<br />
<strong>Procedure :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Pass the coil through the two holes of cardboard in such a way that half of the loop is above the cardboard and remaining part should be below it and normal to the plane of cardboard.</li>
<li>Connect the circuit as shown.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8565/29358045800_6e60cac6b1_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-1" width="418" height="277" /></li>
<li>Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard.</li>
<li> Allow the current to pass though the coil by inserting plug in the key.</li>
<li>Note the pattern of iron filings that emerges on the cardboard after tapping gently a few times. (Observation).</li>
<li>Place the compass at any point over the pattern of field. Observe the direction of needle. (Observation 2).</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Observations :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>(a) Iron filings are arranged in the form of concentric circles.<br />
(b) The concentric circles become larger and larger as we move away from the wire.<br />
(c) At the centre of loop, lines are almost straight and perpendicular to the plane of the loop.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The concentric circles at every point of a current carrying circular loop represent the magnetic field around it.</li>
<li>Magnetic field line close to the axis of loop is straight and is perpendicular to the plane of the coil.</li>
<li>Field lines keep on diverging as we move away from the centre of loop.</li>
</ol>

<strong> Answer.</strong> Solenoid: A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wound on a cylindrical insulating body (i.e., cardboard etc.) such that its length is greater than its diameter is called solenoid.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8672/29358045700_0a1101f816_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-2" width="300" height="84" /><br />
When current is flowing through the solenoid, the magnetic field line pattern resembles exactly with those of a bar magnet with the fixed polarity,<br />
i.e. North and South pole at its ends and it acquires the directive and attractive properties similar to bar magnet. Hence, the current carrying solenoid behave as a bar magnet.<br />
Use of current carrying solenoid: It is used to form a temporary magnet called electromagnet as well as permanent magnet.</p>
<p><strong>3.For the current carrying solenoid as shown below, draw magnetic field lines and giving reason explain that out of the three points A, B and C at which point the field strength is maximum and at which point it is minimum.</strong><br />

<strong>Answer.</strong> Outside the solenoid magnetic field is minimum. At the ends of solenoid, magnetic field strength is half to that inside it. So Minimum &#8211; at point B; Maximum &#8211; at point A<br />

<p><strong>4. With the help of a diagram of experimental setup describe an activity to show that the force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field increases with increase in field strength.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
<strong>Aim :</strong> To show that force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field increases with the field strength.<br />
Apparatus Required : Aluminium rod, stand horse shoe magnet of different intensity, cell, key and connecting wires.<br />
<strong>Procedure :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>.Arrange the set-up as shown in figure.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8544/29022431354_2f2d1ab35f_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-5" width="271" height="192" /><br />
2.Plug the key, the current flowing through the rod from Q to P observe the displacement of rod.<br />
3.Now unplug the key and remove the first horse shoe magnet and place the second horse shoe magnet of higher magnetic field strength in a similar manner to that of first.<br />
4.Plug the key, the current again flow through the rod from Q to P. Again observe the deflection of rod.<br />
5.Now bring both&#8217;the magnet closer together (to ensure greater magnetic field than that of previous case). Again observe the motion of rod.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Observations :</strong> Each time, the conductor moves faster than that of previous one. It is possible only when conductor gets accelerated more each time which required more force. (F = ma)<br />
Thus, if the magnetic field strength is increased, the rod will experience a greater force and move faster.<br />
Conclusion : The force acting on a current carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field increases with increase in field strength.</p>
<p><strong>5.What are magnetic field lines? Justify the following statements</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Two magnetic field lines never intersect each other.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Magnetic field lines are closed curves.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
Magnetic field lines: It is defined as the path along which the unit North pole (imaginary) tends to move in a magnetic field if free to do so.<br />
(a) The magnetic lines of force do not intersect (or cross) one another. If they do so then at the point of intersection, two tangents can be drawn at that point which indicates that there will be two different directions of the same magnetic which field, i.e. the compass needle points in two different directions which is not possible.<br />
(b) Magnetic field lines are closed continuous curves. They diverge from the north pole of a bar magnet and converge its south pole. Inside the magnet they move from south pole to north pole.</p>

<p><strong>6.(a) Describe activity with labelled diagram to show that a current carrying</strong><br />
<strong> conductor experience a force in a magnetic field.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) State the rule to determine the direction of force.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) Without using a magnet, magnetic field can be produced by flowing the current through a straight conductor or a solenoid.<br />
<strong>Aim :</strong> To show that magnetic field exerts a force on a current carrying conductor.<br />
Apparatus required : Aluminium rod, stand, strong horse shoe magnet, cell, key and connecting wires.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8144/29358045410_cc9841d9a5_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-6" width="274" height="230" /><br />
<strong>Procedure :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Hang the aluminium rod with the help of clamp stand such that it passes between the North and South pole of the magnet with the magnetic field directed upwards and the rod being horizontal and perpendicular to the field.</li>
<li>Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery, a key as shown in figure.</li>
<li>Plug the key, the current flows through the rod from Q to P and observe the direction of motion of the rod.</li>
<li>Reverse the direction of current by reversing the battery connection. Again observe the direction of displacement of aluminium rod.</li>
<li>Restore the original direction of current and change the direction of field vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet. Observe the deflection of rod again.</li>
<li>Place the wire parallel to magnetic field and allow the current to pass through it. Check the deflection of rod again.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Observation :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>On plugging the key in step 3, the aluminium rod moves towards left.</li>
<li>In step 4, rod displaces towards right.</li>
<li>In step 5, rod moves towards right again.</li>
<li>In step 6, rod does not move in any direction.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Conclusion</b><strong> :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Magnetic field exerts a force on a current carrying conductor.</li>
<li>The force exerted on the current carrying conductor depends upon the direction of current and direction of magnetic field acting on it.</li>
<li>Displacement of the rod or the magnetic force on it is largest when the direction of current is at right angle to the direction of magnetic field.</li>
<li> When current carrying conductor is placed parallel to the magnetic field, it experiences no force.<br />
(b) Direction of force experienced by a current carrying straight conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it is given by Fleming’s left hand rule.<br />
Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of left hand in such a way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the forefinger points in the direction of magnetic field and the middle finger in the direction of current, then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.</li>

<p><strong>7.Why and when does a current carrying conductor kept in a magnetic field experience force? List the factors on which direction of this force depends?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> The drifting of free electrons of a conductor in a definite direction causes the current to flow through it. When such conductor is placed in a uniform magnetic field, each drifted electron of a conductor experience a magnetic force. This force is collectively experience by a conductor as a whole. Hence a current carrying conductor kept in a magnetic field experience a force. The direction of magnetic force depends on<br />
(i) direction of current through the conductor, and<br />
(ii) direction of magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>8.How is the strength of magnetic field near a straight current-conductor</strong><br />
<strong> (i) related to the strength of current in the conductor?</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) is affected by changing the direction of flow of current in the conductor?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(i) The strength of magnetic field around a straight current conductor increases<br />
on increasing the strength of current in the conductor or vice versa.<br />
(ii)The direction of magnetic field around a straight current carrying conductor gets reversed if the direction of current through that conductor is reversed.</p>
<p><strong>9.What is meant by the term ‘frequency of an alternating current’? What is its value in India? Why is an alternating current considered to be advantageous over direct current for long range transmission of electric energy?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Frequency of Alternating current is equal to the number of cycles completed in one second.</li>
<li> In India, frequency of AC is 50 Hz i.e. 50 cycles per second.</li>
<li> An alternating current is considered to be advantageous over direct current for long range transmission of electric energy because it can be transmitted over long distances to distant places without much loss of electric power as compared to direct current.</li>

<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
<strong>(a) Aim:</strong> How electric fuse works?<br />
<strong>Apparatus required :</strong> Two nails, card board, very thin aluminium strip, a 12 V battery, key and connecting wires.<br />
<strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Insert the two nails vertically on the card board.</li>
<li> Take very thin aluminium strip and tie it between the nails.</li>
<li>Make a circuit as shown in figure with 12 V battery and key with the help of connecting wires.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8787/29022431704_e3cab10807_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-10" width="330" height="239" /></li>
<li> If there are any fans running in the room, switch them off.</li>
<li> Now switch on the current in the circuit by pressing the key or by moving the switch of the ‘ON’ position.</li>
<li> Now pass the current through the circuit for some time. Observe the strand of aluminium strip between the two nails carefully.<br />
Observation: The strand of aluminum strip melt and break quickly on passing the large electric current through it.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> When current flows through the circuit, exceed the rating of aluminium strip, i.e. safe limit, its temperature increases. This make it overheated. As a result, aluminium strip melts and breaks the circuit. Hence, very thin aluminium strip between the two nails acts as a fuse wire. This activity shows that how fuse works.<br />

<li> Green colour insulation wire &#8211; Earth wire</li>
</ol>
<p>Live wire is at higher potential of 220 V while neutral wire is at zero potential. So, potential difference between red and black insulation wire is 220 V.</p>

<strong>Select the figure that represents the correct pattern of field lines. Give reasons for your answer. Also name the poles of the magnets facing each other.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Figure B represents the correct pattern of field lines. In figure A, field lines cross each other which is not possible because if they cross each other, at the point of intersection, there would be two directions of field lines.<br />
In figure B, field lines are emerging in nature, so poles of magnet facing each other are north poles while opposite faces will have south polarity.</p>

<p><strong>27. What is short circuiting? State one factor/condition that can lead to it. Name a device in the household that acts as a safety measure for it. State the principle of its working.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Short circuiting: When electric circuit offers very low resistance to the flow of current through it, the current increases heavily and the circuit is said to be short circuited. It occurs when live wire touches the neutral wire. This happens due to the damage in insulation of the power lines.<br />
Safety measure device: Fuse.<br />
Working principle of fuse: It works on the heating effect of electric current or Joule’s law of heating. According to this law, the heat produced in a resistor is directly proportional to the<br />
(i) square of current for a given resistance.<br />
(ii) resistance for a given current and<br />
(iii) time for which the current flows through the resistor.<br />
H = I2Rt<br />
So, when current in the circuit increases, the wire with low melting point in it melts to the heat generated. Hence, the circuit breaks and electrical devices and appliances are saved. _</p>

(a) Right-hand thumb rule is used to find the direction of magnetic field in a coil of wire and the electric current in a straight conductor.<br />
(b) Fleming’s left hand rule is used to find the direction of force exerted on a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field as in electric motor.<br />
(c) Fleming’s right hand rule is used to find the direction of induced current in a closed circuit placed in changing magnetic field as in electric generator.</p>
<p><strong>29. State one main difference between A.C. and D.C. Why is A.C. preferred over D.C. for long range transmission of electric power? Name one source each of D.C. and A.C.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Difference between A.C. and D.C.: The alternating current (A.C.) reverses its direction periodically whereas the direct current (D.C.) always flows in one direction.<br />
A.C. is preferred over D.C. because it can be transmitted over long distance without much loss of energy.<br />
D.C. source: Battery A.C. source: A.C. generator</p>

<p><strong>30.Two coils of insulated copper wire are wound over a non -conducting cylinder as shown. Coil I has larger number of turns.</strong><br />
<strong> (i) Write your observations when,</strong><br />
<strong> (a) key K is closed,</strong><br />
<strong> (b) key K is opened.</strong><br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8169/29358215350_66525c5b06_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-21" width="304" height="133" /><br />
<strong>(ii)When the current is passed continuously through coil I.</strong><br />
<strong> Give reason for your observations.</strong><br />
<strong> (iii)Name and state the phenomenon responsible for the above observation.</strong><br />
<strong> (iv) Write the name of the rule that is used to determine the direction of current produced in the phenomenon.</strong><br />
<strong> (v) Name the two coils used in this experiment.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(i) (a) When key is closed, the galvanometer needle deflects momentarily in one direction. ,<br />
<strong>Reason:</strong> When key is closed, magnetic field lines around coil 2 increases momentarily. This causes an induced current to flow through it and hence deflection occurs in one direction.<br />
(b) When key is opened, the galvanometer needle deflects again momentarily but in opposite direction.<br />
<strong>Reason:</strong> When key is open, magnetic field lines around coil 2 decreases momentarily. This causes an induced current to flow in opposite direction. Hence, deflection occurs in opposite direction.<br />
(ii) When current is passed continuously through coil I, no deflection is observed in the galvanometer.<br />
<strong>Reason:</strong> There will be no change in magnetic field lines passing through the coil 2. Hence, no induced current will be set up in coil 2.<br />
(iii) The phenomenon observed in above cases is electromagnetic induction. It is a process by which a changing magnetic field in a conductor induces a current in another conductor placed nearby.<br />
(iv) Fleming’s right hand rule<br />
(v) Coil I &#8211; Primary coil Coil II &#8211; Secondary coil</p>

<p><strong>35.Explain the role of fuse in series with any electrical appliance in an electric circuit. Why should a fuse with defined rating for an electric circuit not be replaced by one with a larger rating?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Fuse is a safety device connected in series with live wire or with any electrical appliance in an electric circuit. It stops the flow of unduly high electric current in the circuit by getting melted due to rise in temperature as per Joule’s law of heating.<br />
High rating fuse wire has the larger capacity. So, it will not stop the flow of any relatively high current. Therefore, electrical devices cannot be protected from the possible damage.</p>
<p><strong>36.The magnetic field associated with a current-carrying straight conductor is in anticlockwise direction. If the conductor was held along the east-west direction, what will be the direction of current through it? Name and state the rule applied to determine the direction of current.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer. </strong>Direction of current &#8211; east to west as determined by Right-hand thumb rule. Ri&#8217;-lu-Uand Thumb Rule: If we hold a current-carrying conductor by right hand in such a way that the stretched thumb is along the direction of current, then the curly fingers around the conductor represents the direction of field lines of magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>37. Two circular coils A and B are placed close to each other. If the current in the coil A is changed, will some current be induced in the coil B? Give reason.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Yes, when a current in coil A changes, magnetic field lines linked with coil B also change. Hence, due to change in number of magnetic field lines, there is an induced current in coil B. ,</p>

(ii) reverses on reversing the current. .<br />
(iii) increases if the number of turns in the coil increases as field is directly<br />
proportional to the number of turns.</p>
<p><strong>39.(a) Mention the factors on which the direction of force experienced by a</strong><br />
<strong> current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field depend.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Under what condition is the force experienced by a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field maximum?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) A proton beam is moving along the direction of a magnetic field. What force is acting on proton beam?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) The direction of force experienced by the current-carrying conductor depends on:<br />
(i) direction of current and<br />
(ii)direction of magnetic field.<br />
(b) When the direction of current is at right angle to the direction of magnetic field, the force is maximum.<br />
(c) No force is experienced by the proton beam. As proton beam is moving along the direction of magnetic field.</p>
<p><strong>40. A coil of insulated copper wire is connected to a galvanometer. What will happen if a bar magnet is (a) pushed into the coil,</strong><br />
<strong> (b) withdrawn from inside the coil,</strong><br />
<strong> (c) held stationary inside the coil?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) When a bar magnet is pushed into the coil, magnetic field lines linked with<br />
the coil changes (increases). It causes the electric current to get induced in it. The needle of galvanometer will move momentarily in one direction.<br />
(b) When a bar magnet is withdrawn from inside the coil, the magnetic field lines linked with the coil changes but in decreasing order. Current will be induced in the coil which will be indicated by deflection of needle in the galvanometer. The deflection is opposite to that in case (a). This indicates that the direction of induced current is now opposite to the direction of induced current in case (a).<br />
(c) When bar magnet is held stationary inside the coil, there is no deflection in the galvanometer. This is because there is no change in magnetic field lines linked with the coil. Hence, no induced current will flow through the coil.</p>
<p><strong>41. State the rule to determine the direction of a</strong><br />
<strong> (a) magnetic field produced around a straight conductor carrying current,</strong><br />
<strong> (b) force experienced by a current-carrying straight conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) Direction of magnetic field produced around a straight current-carrying conductor is given by right-hand thumb rule.<br />
If we hold a current-carrying conductor in a right hand in such a way that the stretched thumb is along the direction of current, then the curly fingers around the conductor represent the direction of magnetic field lines.<br />
(b) Direction of force experienced by a current-carrying straight conductor placed in a magnetic field which is perpendicular to it, is given by Fleming’s left hand rule.<br />
Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of left hand in such a way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the forefinger points to the direction of magnetic field and the middle finger points to the direction of current, then the thumb will point to the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor.</p>

<p><strong>44.(i)With the help of an activity, explain the method of inducing electric current in a coil with a moving magnet. State the rule used to find the direction of electric current thus generated in the coil.</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) Two circular coils P and Q are kept close to each other, of which coil P carries a current. What will you observe in Q</strong><br />
<strong> (a) if current in the coil P is changed?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) if both the coils are moved in the same direction with the same speed? Give reason.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(i) Take a coil AB of wire having a large number of turns.<br />
Connect the ends of coil to a sensitive galvanometer as shown in figure.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8418/29022782934_f2f38929f3_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-30" width="306" height="128" /><br />
Take a strong bar magnet and move its north pole towards the end ‘A’ of coil. The deflection in the needle of galvanometer indicates that the induced current flows in the circuit in anticlockwise direction. The end A of the coil behaves as a north pole.<br />
When north pole of the magnet moves away from the coil, the deflection in the galvanometer occurs but in opposite direction.<br />
Similar observations can be made when south pole of the magnet is moved towards the coil or away from it.<br />
When magnet is kept at rest with respect to the coil, the deflection in the needle of galvanometer drops to zero.<br />
Thus, the motion of a magnet, with respect to the coil, produces an induced potential difference which sets up an induced electric current in the circuit.<br />
The direction of electric current thus generated in the coil can be found by using the Fleming’s right-hand rule.<br />
(ii)Fleming’s right-hand rule: Stretch the thumb, forefinger and middle finger of right hand in such a way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the forefinger indicates the direction of magnetic field and thumb shows the direction of motion of the conductor, then the middle finger will indicate the direction of induced current.<br />
(a) If current in the coil P is changed, the magnetic field lines of forces linked with coil Q also change. So, induced potential difference is set up in the coil Q. This results in induced electric current in coil Q which opposes the change in current in coil P.<br />
(b) If both the coils are moved in the same direction with the same speed, there will be no relative motion between them and hence, there will be no change in magnetic field lines of force associated with the secondary coil. Hence, no current will be induced in the coil.</p>

<p><strong>46. A coil of insulated wire is connected to a galvanometer. What would be seen if a bar magnet with its north pole towards one face of the coil is</strong><br />
<strong> (i) moved quickly towards it,</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) moved quickly away from the coil and</strong><br />
<strong> (iii) placed near its one face?</strong><br />
<strong> Name the phenomenon involved.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(i) Deflection in the galvanometer needle will be more on right-side.<br />
(ii) Larger deflection in opposite direction as compared to the case (i) will be seen. (Hi) No deflection.<br />
The phenomenon involved is electromagnetic induction.</p>
<p><strong>47.Two coils A and B of insulated wires are kept close to each other. Coil A is connected to a galvanometer while coil B is connected to a battery through a key. What would happen if</strong><br />
<strong> (i) a current is passed through coil B by plugging the key, and (ii) the current is stopped by removing the plug from the key?</strong><br />
<strong> Explain your answer mentioning the name of the phenomenon involved.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong>In both the given cases, galvanometer shows momentary deflection but in opposite direction. In coil A, magnetic field lines [increased in case (i) and decreased in case (ii)] induce a potential difference across the coil A which sets up induced electric current in coil A. It is shown by the deflection in galvanometer. This is known as electromagnetic induction.</p>

<p><strong>51.Consider a circular loop of wire lying in the plane of the paper. Let the current</strong><br />
<strong> pass through the loop clockwise. With the help of a diagram, explain how the direction of the magnetic field can be determined inside and outside the loop. Name the law used to find the direction of magnetic field.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Consider a circular loop of wire of radius r with centre O lying in the plane of the paper. Let the current i pass through the loop clockwise. According to right hand thumb rule, direction of magnetic field due to any portion of small current carrying length of the coil is:<br />
Direction of magnetic field inside the loop — Perpendicular to the plane of paper inwards.<br />
Direction of magnetic field outside the loop — Perpendicular to the plane of paper outwards.<br />
<img class="aligncenter" src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8085/29538144112_5df565cb03_o.png" alt="magnetic-effects-electric-current-chapter-wise-important-questions-class-10-science-33" width="123" height="135" /><br />
So, the direction of magnetic field can be considered as the direction of total magnetic field due to circular coil as current through all the elements will contribute to the magnetic field in the same direction.</p>
