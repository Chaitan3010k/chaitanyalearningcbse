<p>Question 31.<br />
Examine any six consequences of the disintegration of USSR. [6]<br />
OR<br />
“Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) has become irrelevant today.” Do you agree with the statement? Support your answer with any three suitable arguments.<br />
Answer:<br />
The disintegration of the second world of the Soviet Union and the socialist systems in Eastern Europe had unfathomable consequences for world politics. These consequences are :<br />
(i) The disintegration of the Soviet Union meant the end of Cold War confrontations. The ideological controversy over whether the socialist system would drub the capitalist system was not an implication any more. The engagement of army and arms race is ended now.</p>
<p>(ii) The US became the sole superpower. Backed by the power and prestige of the US, the capitalist economy was the dominant economic system now. Organizations like World Bank and IMF became powerful advisors to all these countries, since they gave them loans for their transition to capitalism.</p>
<p>(iii) Disintegration of the Soviet Union led to the foundation for the emergence of many new countries. All these countries had their own independent aspirations and choices. Some of them, especially the Baltic and east European states, wanted to join the European Union and become part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).</p>
<p>(iv) Disintegration of the Soviet Union ended the bipolar system and laid the foundation of unipolar system.</p>
<p>(v) Privatization of state assets and corporate ownership patterns were to be immediately brought in. Collective farms were to be replaced by private farming arid capitalism.</p>
<p>(vi) Disintegration of the Soviet Union resulted a breakup of the existing trade alliances among the countries of the Soviet bloc. Each state from this bloc was now linked directly to the West and not to each other in the region. These states were thus to be gradually absorbed into the Western economic system.<br />
OR<br />
Non-alignment, as the name suggests, means a decision of not associating oneself with any of the groups. This policy was of great relevance till the cold war. But then the cold war ended and with the collapse of Soviet Union, the world order started to change. The world since the cold war has had wide-ranging impact on global politics. With the disappearance of Bi-polar system followed by uni¬polarity and now with changing nature of power and power relations, with the rise of India, China and other powers; the world is moving towards multi-polarity. Thus, it has posed a new fundamental question of ‘Non-alignment’ against whom? In the era of liberalization and globalisation, the world has become a unified society, where all nations depend on each other for trade and commerce.</p>
<p>The world has become cosmopolitan and a country cannot survive if it follows the ‘policy of isolation’ or ‘policy of non-interference’. In such a scenario, relevance of NAM is often questioned. Even though the goals of NAM have changed since its formation, it cannot be said to occupy the same position in the international society as it enjoyed earlier. Today it’s more focused on economic issues, issues like terrorism, health. NAM summits are merely a repetition of the resolutions of the UN and its agencies. Thus, the scheduling of regular summit meetings and increasing membership of NAM cannot be considered any evidence of its relevance.</p>
<p>Question 32.<br />
Analyze India s stand on any three environmental issues. [6]<br />
OR<br />
Assess any three basis on which globalization is being resisted in India.<br />
Answer:<br />
India has been criticized for its apparent lack of commitment to addressing global climate change. But these aims are not mutually exclusive. National measures can and are benefiting India’s development while helping mitigate climate change. The problem is that India hasn’t marketed these initiatives in the right way.<br />
(i) A defensive stance: India’s&#8217; international negotiating position relies heavily on the principles of historical responsibility, as enshrined in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This acknowledges that developed countries are responsible for most historical and current greenhouse emissions, and emphasizes that “economic and social development are the first and overriding priorities of the developing country parties”,</p>
<p>(ii) India is taking real action : In fact, the Indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes. For example, India’s National Auto-fuel Policy mandates cleaner fuels for vehicles. The Energy Conservation Act, passed in 2001, outlines initiatives to improve energy efficiency. Similarly, the Electricity Act of 2003 encourages the use of renewable energy. Recent trends in importing natural gas and encouraging the adoption of Clean Coal technologies shows that India is making real efforts.</p>
<p>(iii) A review of the implementation of the agreements at the earth summit in Rio was undertaken by India. One of the key conclusions was that there had been no meaningful progress with respect to transfer of new and additional financial resources and environmental sound technology on ‘concessional’ terms to developing nations.<br />
OR<br />
Three reasons for resistance to globalisation:<br />
(i) Leftist argue that contemporary globalisation represents a particular phase of global capitalism that expands the breach between the rich and the poor. The state is becoming weak and the capacity of the state to do welfare of poor people is getting reduced. Resistance to globalisation in India has come from different quarters. Trade unions of industrial workforce, as well as those protecting farmer interests have organised protests against the entry of the multinationals.</p>
<p>(ii) Economically, they want a return to self-reliance and protectionism, at least in certain areas of the economy, expecially in export-import and investment. Most anti-globalisation movements are opposed to a specific programme of globalisation which they see as a form of imperialism. In 1999, at the high meeting, there were widespread protests at seated, alleging unfair trade practices by economically powerful states.</p>
<p>(iii) Culturally, critics are worried that traditional culture i.e., music, dress and language etc. will be harmed and people will lose their age-old values and ways. Influence of western culture on food, dress can be an example in support of the same.</p>
<p>Question 33.<br />
Explain any three reasons for the dominance of Congress Party in the first three general elections in India. &#8216; [6]<br />
OR<br />
How did the reorganization of States take place in India after its Independence? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
Any three reasons for the dominance of congress party in the first three elections in India:<br />
(i) The roots of the extraordinary success of the Congress party go back to the legacy of the freedom struggle. Congress was seen as an inheritor of the national movement. Many leaders who were in the forefront of that struggle, were now contesting elections as congress candidates. By the time of independence, the party had an organisational network down to the local level, spread across the whole country.</p>
<p>(ii) The congress party began as a party dominated by the English speaking, urban elite, but with every civil disobedience movement it launched, its social base widened. Peasants, industrialists, urban dwellers, villagers all found space in the Congress. By the time of independence, the Congress had transformed into a rainbow-like social coalition, which gave it unusual strength.</p>
<p>(iii) The congress had the most popular and charismatic leader in Nehruji, who dominated the Indian National Congress and led it to victory in three consecutive elections.<br />
OR<br />
The States Reorganization Act, 1956 was a major reform of the boundaries of India’s states and territories, organizing them along linguistic lines.</p>
<p>Although additional changes to India’s state boundaries have been made since 1956, the States Reorganization Act of 1956 remains the single most extensive change in state boundaries since the independence of India in 1947.</p>
<p>Between 1947 and about 1950, the territories of the princely states were politically integrated into the Indian Union. Most were merged into existing provinces; others were organized into new provinces, such as Rajputana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Bharat, and Vindhya Pradesh, a few, including Mysore, Hyderabad, Bhopal, and Bilaspur, became separate provinces.</p>
<p>Demand of states on linguistic basis was developed even before the independence of India under British rule. Though that time, Indian administrative regions were identified as different provinces. Odisha was the first Indian state formed on linguistic basis in the year 1936 due to the efforts of Madhusudhan Das and became Orissa Province.. In December 1953, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru appointed the States Reorganisation&#8217;’ Commission to recognize the Indian states known as the Fazal Ali Commission. The Commission created a report on September 30, 1955 recommending the reorganization of India’s states. The parliament debated on the report. Finally, a bill making changes in the constitution and reorganizing states was passed and was implemented from November 1,1956.</p>
<p>Question 34.<br />
Examine any six reasons for the imposition of emergency in India in 1975. [6]<br />
OR<br />
Examine the major issues which led to the split of Congress Party in 1969.<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) From the early 1970^ onwards, disappointment and discontent shook India: large sections of the population came out in demonstrations against rising prices, there was a fall in the supply of essential commodities, unemployment, and more importantly, corruption in government administration.</p>
<p>(ii) These protests reached a crescendo in two states— Gujarat and Bihar — in 1974, with students leading the agitations and giving them an organized shape. The Gujarat state government ruled by Indira Gandhi’s Congress Party was forced to resign that year. In fresh elections to the Gujarat legislature in early June, 1975.</p>
<p>(iii) The Congress was trounced and the opposition parties formed the new government in that state. Indira realized that she was losing her grip, and was threatened, by a political crisis.</p>
<p>(iv) The threat became imminent when on June 12,1975, the Allahabad High Court of the state of Uttar Pradesh (from where Indira Gandhi won in the parliamentary election in 1971), declared her election invalid on two corruption charges in the conduct of her poll campaign at that time.</p>
<p>(v) She was accused of violating the Indian law by first, using an officer of her government to make campaign arrangements, and secondly, by using other state officers to put up speaker’s stands in her constituency and supply electricity to her amplifying equipment.</p>
<p>(vi) This political instability was responsible for the emergency.<br />
OR<br />
Three causes of the split in the congress party in 1969 :<br />
(i) Differences with the syndicate: After the 1967 elections, PM Indira Gandhi had to deal with the syndicate, a group of powerful and influential leaders from within the congress, who had played a major role in her election as the leader of the party. These leaders expected her to follow their advice. However, Indira Gandhi gradual attempted to strengthen her position and carefully sidelined the Syndicate. Their rivalry came in the open in 1969 over the presidential elections following President Zakir Hussain’s death and also differences over the reforms introduced by Indira Gandhi.</p>
<p>(ii) Presidential Elections 1969: Following President Zakir Hussain&#8217;s death, the post of the President of India fell vacant in 1969. Despite Mrs. Gandhi’s reservations, the ‘Syndicate’ nominated her long time opponent, N. Sanjeeva Reddy as the official congress candidate. Indira Gandhi retaliated by encouraging Vice-president V. V. Giri to file his nomination as an independent candiate. The defeat of N. Sanjeeva Reddy formalised the split in the party into congress (organisation) and that led by Indira Gandhi as congress (Requisitionists).</p>
<p>(iii) Reforms by Indira Gandhi : Revolutionary steps taken by Indira Gandhi were not welcomed by the Congress leaders. She had launched a series of initiatives like public distribution of food grains, land reforms, nationalisation of fourteen private banks a abolition of the ‘privy purse’ or the special privileges given to former princess. Her policies were opposed by Morarji Desai and older leaders, too, had serious reservations about this left programme.</p>

(i) Everyone believed that the real organisational strength of the congress party was under the command of congress (O). All the opponents of Indira Gandhi formed a Grand Alliance, yet congress (R) led by her, had an agenda, which the alliance lacked. They had only one comon aim—Indira Hatao. In contrast, she put forward a positive programme captured in the famous slogan—Garibi Hatao.</p>
<p>(ii) Indira Gandhi focused on the growth of the public sector, removal of disparities in income and opportunity and the abolition of princely priviliges. Thus, the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ and the reforms that followed, made her very popular and she won 352 seats in the Lok Sabha elections of 1971.</p>
<p>(iii) The 1971 elections were followed by a major political and military crisis in East Pakistan and the Indo-Pak war, leading to victory for India and the establishment of Bangladesh. These events added to the popularity of Indira Gandhi and even the opposition admired her statesmanship.</p>

Highlight any two effects of the elections in 1989 on the politics of India. [2]<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The defeat of Congress party in 1989 marked the end of Congress dominance over the Indian party system. However, it did not mean the emergence of any other single party to fill in its place.</li>
<li>It began an era of multi-party system. To be sure, a large number of political parties always contested elections in our country. This is how alliance politics came into existence in India.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 23.<br />
Explain the Hegemony of the United States as a Soft power. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
This notion of hegemony suggests that a dominant power deploys not only military power, but also ideological resources to shape the behaviour of competition with lesser powers.</p>
<p>The predominance of the US in the world today is based not only on its military and economic powers but also on its cultural presence. All ideas of the good life and personal success, most of the dreams of individuals and societies across the globe are dreams churned out by practices prevailing in 20th century America.

OR<br />
Assess any three happenings which were responsible for the downfall of the Congress Party in the 1977 elections.<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) PM Jawaharlal Nehru passed away in May 1964. India faced two big challenges during Shastriji’s reign like ‘Economic Crisis’ due to Indo-China war of 1962, Indo-Pak war of 1965, failed monsoons, droughts, and food crisis, ‘Jai Jawan Jai Kisan’, was devised to encourage the people to come together and help in solving these issues.</p>
<p>(ii) The Congress party faced the challenge of political succession for the second time after the death of Shastriji with intense competition between Morarji Desai and Indira Gandhi, which resulted in the victory of Indira Gandhi. However, when her government devalued the rupee to check the economic crisis of 1967, it led to price rise and widespread protests. This gave birth to brought in the concept of coalitions.</p>
<p>(iii) The formal split in congress came into the open in 1969 on the nominations for presidential elections. Indira Gandhi’s candidate V.V. Giri won over Syndicate’s N. Sanjeeva Reddy and the Congress split into Congress (O) led by Syndicate and Congress (R) led by Indira Gandhi.<br />
OR<br />

The opposition called for a restoration of democracy and Indians saw the election results as a repudiation of the emergency.</p>
<p>(ii) Indira Gandhi had become extremely unpopular for her decision and paid for it during the next elections. Mrs. Gandhi, on 23 January, called for fresh elections and released all political prisoners.</p>
<p>(iii) Four Opposition parties, the Congress (Organization), the Jan Sangh, the Bharatiya Lok Dal, and the Socialist Party, decided to fight the elections under a single banner called the Janata alliance. The alliance used the symbol allocated to Bharatiya Lok Dal as their symbol on the ballot papers. The Janata alliance reminded voters of the excesses and human rights violations during the Emergency, like compulsory sterilization and imprisonment of political leaders.</p>
