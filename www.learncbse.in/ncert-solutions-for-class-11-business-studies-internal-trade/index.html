<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS SOLVED</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>I. Short Answer Type Questions</strong></span><br />
<strong> Question 1. What is meant by internal trade?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Internal trade refers to the buying and selling of goods and services within the domestic territory of a country. It is known as internal trade. In other words, the process of exchanging goods and services within the national boundaries of a country is called internal trade. Purchases of goods from a local shop, a mall or an exhibition are all examples of internal trade. The government does not levy customs or import duties on goods and services that are produced within the country for meeting the domestic demand.<br />
Internal trade can be classified into the following two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Retail Trade:</strong> It refers to the buying and selling of goods in small quantities for final consumption.</li>
<li><strong>Wholesale Trade:</strong> It refers to the buying and selling of goods in bulk, i.e., the exchange of large quantities of goods meant for resale in local markets.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 2. Specify the characteristics of fixed shop retailers.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> As the name suggests, fixed-shop retailers are retailers who have permanent establishments. It means that they sell goods and services from fixed shops and do not move from place to place to serve customers. For example, retailers functioning from fixed establishments in the local grocery market.<br />
The following are some of the characteristics of fixed-shop retailers:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fixed-shop retailers operate on a large scale and have huge resources at their disposal compared with itinerant traders. However, among fixed-shop retailers, there are retailers who operate on a small scale or a large scale.</li>
<li>They generally deal in more than one product—that is, their range of goods varies from consumer durable goods to non-durable goods.</li>
<li>Fixed-shop retailers provide services such as free home delivery and supply of goods on credit to their customers.</li>
<li>They have a greater credibility in the eyes of consumer as they can be traced if the product is found to be defective or there is any other problem.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 3. What purpose is served by wholesalers providing warehousing facilities?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Wholesalers purchase goods in bulk from manufacturers, store them and distribute them to retailers in small quantities for further resale. This bulk purchase of goods enables manufacturers to undertake production on a large scale without worrying about storage facilities. By offering warehouses close to the centres of distribution, wholesalers provide what is known as ‘place utility’. Wholesalers not only provide warehousing facilities such as collection, storage and protection of goods but also facilitate marketing and distribution, creating ‘time utility.</p>
<p><strong>Question 4. How does market information provided by wholesalers benefit the manufacturers?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Wholesalers provide a variety of information to both manufacturers and customers. To manufacturers, they provide information about:</p>
<ol>
<li>The tastes and preferences of customers</li>
<li>Conditions prevailing in the market</li>
<li>Level of competition in the market and</li>
<li>Types of goods and features demanded by consumers.<br />
This information helps manufacturers to cater to the changing needs of consumers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 5. How do the wholesalers help the manufacturer in availing the economies of scale?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Wholesalers often purchase goods in bulk quantities from manufacturers. Once a purchase is made, the wholesalers distribute the goods in small quantities to retailers for further resale. However, during this process, they provide manufacturers with a variety of warehousing facilities such as collection, storage, marketing and distribution of goods. These services reduce the burden on manufacturers by creating time and place utility, thus enabling them to produce goods on a large scale and benefit from the economies of scale.</p>
<p><strong>Question 6. Distinguish between single line stores and specialty stores. Can you identify such stores in your locality?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Single-line stores are small shops that deal in only one product. For example, garments or shoes. However, single-line stores offer a wide variety of the product. For instance, a single-line store that deals in garments will have a wide variety of clothes in all sizes for men, women and children.<br />
On the other hand, specialty stores deal only in a particular type of product from a selected product line. For example, men’s clothing. Such stores generally sell all the brands of the product in which they specialise. For instance, if a store specialises in men’s clothing, then it will have all the brands of men’s garments.<br />
On the basis of these features, we can identify the different types of stores in a locality—whether they are single-line stores or specialty stores.<br />
Single line stores are more frequently found in local retail markets while specialty stores are found in wholesale markets.</p>

<strong>Question 1. Itinerant traders have been an integral part of internal trade in India. Analyse the reasons for their survival in spite of competition from large scale retailers.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Itinerant traders are retailers who do not have a fixed place of operation. That is, they do not have a shop from where they sell their products. They are also known as mobile traders as they keep moving from place to place in order to sell their products. They are generally found on street sides, and they shift their place of operation in search of more customers. They usually sell low-priced and non-standard goods.<br />
The reasons that itinerant traders survive in spite of the tough competition from large-scale retailers can be attributed to the following factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is very easy to set up a small scale retail shop. One person with limited funds himself can start business. He need not associate other persons and no formalities are necessary.</li>
<li>A small scale retail shop can be located anywhere. It can provide goods of daily use near the place of consumers. They are not required to travel to big markets.</li>
<li>The small scale retailer knows his customers. He can attend to them personally and cater to their individual tastes and needs. Such personalised service is not available in large scale retail stores.</li>
<li>Small scale retailers cater to the masses that have limited income and can afford to buy small quantity. In India majority of the population is poor.</li>
<li>It is easy to manage and control a small sale retail shop. The owner himself is the manager. He has direct motivation to work hard and increase the efficiency of business. He takes personal interest in his business organisations.</li>
<li>Small amount of capital is required to start a small retail shop. People with small amount of funds can start retail business on a small scale.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 2. Discuss the features of a departmental store. How are they different from multiple shops or chain stores?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Departmental stores are basically large, fixed establishments that deal in a wide variety of products. The following points highlight the features of a departmental store:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Central locations:</strong> Department stores are generally located in central areas so as to attract a large number of customers.</li>
<li><strong>Defined hierarchy:</strong> The management in departmental stores follows the same hierarchy that is generally followed in any joint stock company. That is, the top management consists of a board of directors, with the managing director, the general manager and the department managers under it in that order.</li>
<li><strong>Absence of middlemen:</strong> Departmental stores purchase goods directly from manufacturers and sell them to customers. Thus, they eliminate the role of middlemen.</li>
<li><strong>Centralised purchase with decentralised sales:</strong> In a departmental store, the purchases from manufacturers are handled by a single division that follows a centralised purchase policy. On the other hand, the sales are handled by the respective sections of the departmental store, which follow a decentralised policy for sales.<br />

</ol>
<p><strong>Question 3. Why are consumers cooperative stores considered to be less expensive? What are its relative advantages over other large scale retailers?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> Consumer cooperative stores are formed by groups of consumers to provide goods at reasonable prices to members of consumer societies. In such societies, the role of middlemen is eliminated as these societies purchase goods from manufacturers or wholesalers directly and sell them to society members at reasonable rates. As consumer cooperative stores do not aim at profit-making, the prices of goods offered by them are much lower than the prices of goods at retail shops. Compared with large-scale retailers, the capital requirement for starting a consumer cooperative society is very low. Thus, consumer cooperative stores do not require much investment, and the goods sold by them are priced lower.<br />
The following are some advantages that consumer cooperative stores have over large- scale retailers:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Democratic management:</strong> Consumer cooperative stores are democratic organisations as they are managed and controlled by elected managing committees of consumer societies. The members of managing committees are elected by the members of consumer societies on the principle of ‘one member, one vote’.</li>
<li><strong>Limited liability:</strong> The liability of the members of consumer cooperative societies is limited to the amount of shares held by them. Thus, in case a society’s liabilities increase beyond the assets, the members will not be liable to repay the debts using their personal assets.</li>
<li><strong>Low price of goods:</strong> As the goods offered by consumer cooperatives are directly purchased from manufacturers and wholesalers, the role of middlemen is eliminated. Therefore, consumer societies are able to sell goods at lower prices.</li>

<p><strong>Question 6. Name and define different large scale retail shops.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> The retail trade is conducted now on a large scale. The mass production of goods and the concentration of population in urban centers has necessitated the establishment of large-scale retail trading houses. There are many advantages of retailing on a large scale.<br />
However, in spite of the economies of large scale retailing, the small-scale units could not be eliminated because of the various special advantages possessed by them. Some of the more prominent large-scale retail organizations are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li> Departmental Stores</li>
<li>Multiple Shops or Chain Stores</li>
<li> Mail Order Houses</li>
<li>Super Markets</li>
<li>Consumer Cooperative Stores</li>
<li> Vending Machines</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><strong>Departmental Stores:</strong> A departmental store is a large-scale retail organisation having a number of departments under one roof. Each department specialises in one particular kind of trade. All these departments are centrally organized and are under one united management and control. A departmental store is an organization of several retail stores carried on in one building and under united controlled management. The basic objective of a departmental store is to provide a large variety or merchandise from a pin to an aeroplane at one place.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple Shops or Chain Stores:</strong> A multiple shop system is a network of branch shops, situated at different localities in the city or in different parts of the country, under a centralised management and dealing in similar lines of goods. Such multiple shops are very common and popular in the west and are known as Chain Stores. According to J.L. Fri, “Chain Stores is a group of stores handling similar lines of merchandise with single ownership and centralised location.” The Federal Trade Commission defined a chain store as “an organization owing a controlling interest in two or more establishments which sell substantially similar merchandise at retail prices.”</li>
<li><strong>Mail Order Sale Houses:</strong> A Mail Order Sale is a retail business where orders are placed by post or mail and goods Eire received either by registered parcel or V.P.P. i.e., Value Payable Post. Under such a type of selling, the seller advertises his products in the leading dailies and magazines of the area and the intending buyers respond to such advertisements by requesting for catalogues and price lists from the seller. The buyers do not inspect the goods before purchasing but place orders on the basis of the advertisements which they see in the newspapers and magazines. After orders are received from customers, the goods are dispatched by V.P.P. or registered mail. The postman of the buyer’s locality delivers the goods to him and takes the payment for the same. Thus the post office plays a vital role in such type of sale, and it is because of this type of sale is also sometimes referred to as “Shopping by Post”.</li>
<li><strong>Super Markets:</strong> The super market is a large-scale retail institution specialising in necessaries and convenience goods. They have huge premises and generally deal in food and non-food articles. In the words of M. M. Zimmerman, “A super market is a departmentalised retail establishment having four basic departments viz, self-service grocery, meat produce, dairy products plus other household departments, doing a maximum business. It may be entirely owner operated or have some of the departments leased out on a concession basis.”Super markets came into existence in the USA during the Great Depression of the thirties. However, the original super markets were established by independent merchants who dealt mainly in food products.</li>
<li><strong>Consumer Co-Operative Stores:</strong> A consumer co-operative is a retail business which is owned by the consumers themselves. Their basic objective is to eliminate middlemen. The consumers join together and manage the business and the profit thus earned is retained among themselves in the proportion of their contribution. The society purchases in bulk and avails the discounts and sells in small lots to the members. Some of the co-operative stores are run on a large-scale basis while others are small in size and nature.</li>
<li><strong>Vending Machines:</strong> Such selling machines are extensively used in the west. The vending machine is operated by inserting a coin and the buyer can get the articles. Vending machines are usually acquired to sell articles like cigarettes, soft drinks, chocolates, candles etc. Railway platform and bus tickets are also sold by this method. The articles sold by a vending machine are pre-packed and labeled and are usually of reputed brands. The goods should be uniform in size and shape and less bulky in weight. The installation of such machines is an expensive affair and it needs regular maintenance also. Such machines are quite attractive in appearance and installed at busy shopping centers.</li>

<p><strong>Question 8. What are the differences between departmental stores and multiple shops?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> The differences between departmental stores and multiple shops are summarized below:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Location:</strong> A departmental store is centrally located and attracts customers towards it. On the other hand, multiple shops are situated in different localities and attempt to reach near the customers.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of goods:</strong> A departmental store deals in a wide variety of products and serves as a universal supplier. On the other hand, a multiple shop specialises in one line of goods.</li>
<li><strong>Type of customers:</strong> A departmental store caters mainly to rich people, whereas multiple shops cater to the general public.</li>
<li><strong>Nature of dealings:</strong> A departmental store sells goods both on cash and credit basis. But multiple shops sell goods on cash and carry basis.</li>
<li><strong>Services:</strong> A departmental store offers banking, post office, restaurant and other facilities to customers. Multiple shops do not offer such services.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Different departments of a departmental store may sell goods at different prices. But all the multiple shops sell goods at the same prices.</li>
<li><strong>Decoration and display:</strong> Every department of a departmental store may have different decoration and display. But all the multiple shops of an owner have uniform shop decoration and window display. A departmental store advertises at local level, whereas multiple shops advertise at national level.</li>
<li><strong>Object:</strong> A departmental store aims at providing everything at one place. Multiple shop system, on the other hand, is an attempt to eliminate middlemen and establish direct contact between the manufacturer and consumers.</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> In a departmental store quick adjustment can be made according to local changes. One line of goods can be substituted by others. Multiple shop system lacks such flexibility.</li>

rate, total value, sales tax, trade discount, etc. It is also called a Bill or Memo. Buyer gets information about the amount he has to pay to the seller from Invoice only.</li>
<li><strong>Performa Invoice:</strong> The “statement (or forwarding letter) containing the details of goods consigned from consigner to consignee is known as a Performa Invoice. It gives the particulars regarding quantity, quality, price and expenses incurred on the goods consigned. In case of consignment, consignee is an agent of consigner who is supposed to sell goods on behalf of consigners and this statement Performa Invoice is only for his information.

The trader contacts the customer through advertisement in newspaper or magazines, circulars, catalogues and price list is sent to them by post. All the information about product such as price, features, delivery terms, terms of payment etc are described in the advertisement. The customers may be asked to make full payment in advance or goods may be sent by VPP (Value Payable Post), under which goods are delivered to the customer only when he makes full payment for the same. The goods may be sent through a bank which delivers them to the customer only when he makes full payment.<br />

</ol>
<p><strong>Limitations of Mail Order Houses:</strong></p>
<ol>

<li>They rely heavily on advertisement and other promotional activities which increases their cost of product.</li>

</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>IV. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)</strong></span><br />
<strong> Question 1. What difficulties will be faced by the manufacturers if wholesalers are eliminated from the chain?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Manufacturer gets following services from retailer which he will not be able to get if wholesaler is eliminated from the chain.</p>
<ol>
<li>By selling under his own brand name the wholesaler often relieves the manufacturer of the need to advertise his product.</li>
<li>The wholesaler removes goods in larger quantities as they are produced, thus clearing the production lines.</li>
<li>By warehousing the goods the wholesaler bridges the time gap between production and consumption, leaving the manufacturer free to concentrate on his specialised activities.</li>
<li>He eliminates the need for a marketing system with all that involves in terms of warehousing space, distribution network, sales staff, accounting records, and debt collection.</li>
<li>By paying promptly the wholesaler reduces the working capital required by the manufacturers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 2. “The chambers interact with the government at different levels to reorient or put in place policies which reduce trade hindrances.” Comment.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> The chambers interact with the government at different levels to reorient or put in place policies which reduce hindrances, increase interstate movement of goods, introduce transparency and remove multiple layers of inspection and bureaucratic hurdles. It also aims at establishing right kind of infrastructure and simplifying and harmonizing the tax structure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transportation:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry help in many activities concerning interstate movement of goods which includes registration of vehicles, surface transport policies, construction of highways and roads.</li>
<li><strong> Octroi and other Local Levies:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry ensures that its imposition is not at the cost of smooth transportation and local trade.</li>
<li><strong>Harmonization between Sales Tax and VAT:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry plays an important role in interacting with the government to harmonize the sales tax structure in different states. A uniform sales tax is important for balanced growth as it is a source of state revenue.</li>
<li><strong>Marketing of Agro products and related issues:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry can intervene and interact with concerned agencies in formulating policies regarding marketing of agro-products and related issues.</li>
<li><strong>Weights and Measures to prevention of duplication in brands:</strong> It is necessary to protect the interests of the consumers as well as traders. They need to be enforced strictly. The Chambers of Commerce and Industry interact with the government and makes such laws which takes action against wrong doers.</li>
<li><strong>Excise Duty:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry play a vital role in streamlining of excise duties.</li>

<li><strong>Labour Legislations:</strong> The Chambers of Commerce and Industry interacts with the government constantly on issues related to labour laws and retrenchment.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3. What difficulties will be faced by the consumers if retailers are eliminated from the chain?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer: </strong> If retailers are removed, it will lead to direct marketing. In general, you cannot save money by “eliminating the middleman” because intermediaries specialize in performing certain tasks that they can perform more cheaply than the manufacturer. Most grocery products are most efficiently sold to the consumer through retail stores that take a modest mark-up—it would not make sense for manufacturers to ship their grocery products in small quantities directly to consumers.<br />
Intermediaries perform tasks such as</p>
<ol>
<li>Moving the goods efficiently (e.g., large quantities are moved from factories or warehouses to retail stores);</li>
<li>Breaking bulk (manufacturers sell to a modest number of wholesalers in large quantities—quantities are then gradually broken down as they make their way toward the consumer);</li>
<li>Consolidating goods (retail stores carry a wide assortment of goods from different manufacturers—e.g., super markets span from toilet paper to catsup); and Aiding services (e.g., demonstrations and repairs).</li>
<li>If these middlemen are eliminated, they will face absence of these functions which will be troublesome for them.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 4. Explain important terms used in context of internal trade.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> The following are the main terms used in the internal trade.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cash on delivery (COD):</strong> It refers to a type of transaction in which payment for goods or services is made at the time of delivery. If the buyer is unable to make payment when the goods or services are delivered, then it will be returned to the seller.</li>
<li><strong>Free on Board or Free on Rail (FOB or FOR):</strong> It refers to a contract between the seller and the buyer in which all the expenses up to the point of delivery to a carrier (it may be a ship, rail, lorry, etc.) are to be borne by seller.</li>
<li><strong>Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF):</strong> It is the price of goods which includes not only the cost of goods but also the insurance and freight charges payable on goods.</li>
<li><strong>E and OE (Errors and Omissions Expected):</strong> It refers to that term which is used in trade documents to say that mistakes and things that have been forgotten should be taken into account. This term is used in an attempt to reduce legal liability for incorrect or incomplete information supplied in a document such as price list, invoice, cash memo, quotation etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>V. Value Based Questions</strong></span><br />
<strong> Question 1. Peddlers and hawkers create traffic indiscipline and therefore it must be declared as illegal. Do you agree? Justify your answer.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> I do not agree. In India it is the most visible segment of the urban informal economy. It is indisputable that there are thousands—and in some cases, tens or hundreds of thousands—of street vendors in most big cities of the developing world. Yet it is exceedingly difficult to produce accurate estimates of the number of street traders in any given city. In some countries, official statistics on street vendors are available, though they underestimate the total number of people engaged in street vending. Without providing them an alternative employment, we cannot think of making it illegal. Yes, for security reasons, they may be asked to get an ID with them or they may be issued a pass by local authorities.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2. Which retail shops are rim by the weaker sections? Do you think they are capable to face competition from large scale retail shops? How do they exist then?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Weaker sections of society run retail shops in following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hawkers and Peddlers:</strong> The hawkers carry their goods in a wheeled vehicle while the peddlers carry the goods on their heads or backs.</li>
<li><strong>Market Traders:</strong> These retailers open their shops at different places on fixed days.</li>
<li> <strong>Street Traders or Pavement Vendors:</strong> These retailers display their goods at busy street corners or pavements.</li>
<li><strong>Cheap Jacks:</strong> These retailers generally hire a small shop in a residential colony for a temporary period.</li>
</ol>
<p>No, they are not capable to face competition from large scale retailers. In fact there I do not have to face competition from large scale retailers because their clientele is different from them. Poor and lower middle class people buy from small retail shops while upper middle class and rich people buy from large scale retail shops. Therefore, they can manage to exist due to following advantages over large scale retail shops.</p>
<ul>
<li>A small scale retailer himself looks after his business. He is not required to employ managers or to spend on advertising, etc. Therefore, he can sell goods at lower prices.</li>
<li> A small scale retailer can take quick decisions. He is not required to consult others.</li>
<li> A small scale retailer can easily adjust his stocks according to the changing needs and fashions of his customers.</li>
<li>A small scale retailer can more easily maintain secrecy of his business affairs.</li>
</ul>
