<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the following passage carefully. [8]<br />
1. Few guessed that this quiet, parentless girl growing up in New York City would one day become the First Lady of the United States. Even fewer thought she would become an author and lecturer and a woman much admired and loved by people throughout the world.<br />
2. Bom Anna Eleanor Roosevelt in 1884 to wealthy, but troubled parents who both died while she was young, Roosevelt was cared for by her grandmother and sent to school in England. In 1905, she married her distant cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. She and her husband had six children. Although they were wealthy, her life was not easy and she suffered several personal tragedies. Her second son died when he was a baby. In 1921, her strong athletic husband was stricken with polio, which left him physically disabled for life.<br />
3. Eleanor Roosevelt was a remarkable woman who had great intelligence and tremendous strength of character. She never let things get her down. She nursed her husband back to good health and encouraged him to remain in politics. She then helped him to become Governor of New York, and in 1933, President of the United States.<br />
4. While her husband was President, she took a great interest in all the affairs of the country. She became her husband&#8217;s legs and eyes; she visited prisons and hospitals; she went down into mines, up scaffoldings and into factories. Roosevelt was tireless and daring. During the depression she travelled all over the country bringing goodwill, reassurance and help to people without food and jobs. During World War II she visited American soldiers in camps all over the world. The United States had never known a First Lady like her.<br />
5. Roosevelt also kept in touch with the American people through a daily newspaper column called &#8216;My Day&#8217;. She broadcast on the radio and delivered lectures, all first for a First Lady.</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below carefully and answer the questions that follow: [12]<br />
1. Overpowering prey is a challenge for creatures that do not have limbs. Some species like Russell&#8217;s viper inject poison. Some others opt for an alternative non-chemical method rat snakes, for instance, catch and push their prey against the ground, while pythons use their muscle power to crush their prey to death. But snakes can&#8217;t be neatly divided into poisonous and non-poisonous categories.<br />
2. Even species listed as non-poisonous aren&#8217;t completely free of poison. The common Sand Boa, for instance, produces secretions particularly poisonous to birds. So the species doesn&#8217;t take any chance—it crushes its prey and injects poison as an extra step.<br />
3. Do vipers need poison powerful enough to kill hundreds of rats with just one drop? After all, they eat only one or two at a time.<br />
4. While hunting animals try their worst to kill most efficiently, their prey use any trick to avoid becoming a meal, such as developing immunity to poison. For instance, Californian ground squirrels are resistant to Northern Pacific rattlesnake poison.<br />
5. Competition with prey is not the only thing driving snakes to evolve more and more deadly poison. Snakes also struggle to avoid becoming prey themselves.<br />
6. Some snake killers have partial immunity to poison. Famously, mongooses are highly resistant to cobra posion and with their speed and agility, kill snakes fearlessly. It would be the death of cobras as a species if they didn&#8217;t evolve a more deadly poison to stop mongooses.<br />
7. Poison has another important role. It&#8217;s an extreme meat softener, specific enzymes break up the insides of the prey. Normally, a reptile depends on the sun&#8217;s warm rays to aid digestion.<br />
8. But I wonder if we cannot use venom in our favour. In remote parts of India, local hospitality often involves leather-tough meat. I chew and chew until may jaw ache. If I spit it out or refuse, our hosts would be offended, I swallow like a python stuffing a deer down its throat and hope I don&#8217;t choke. If only I had poison.</p>
<p>Question 2.1.<br />

(b) Sand Boa produces secretions particularly poisonous to birds. It crushes its prey and injects poison as an extra step.<br />
(c) The hunting animals try their worst to kill their prey most efficiently but their prey use any trick to avoid becoming a meal.<br />

Sub — Attacks on old people<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your reputed newspaper, I show my deep concern and draw the attention of the government towards the growing feeling of fear and insecurity among people due to frequent attacks on old people living alone.<br />
The recent attacks on old people clearly indicate lapses on our part. In addition to this, social media and different reports are creating disharmony instead of doing something constructive. The old people are not safe in their own homes. These attacks have taken away their peace and tranquility. Many old people have lost their lives. This shatters the faith of people in the government.<br />
In order to combat this menace, we should make concerted efforts. Those who are caught and found guilty should be taught a lesson.<br />
I hope the authorities will be more cautious and initiate stern steps to encounter the enemies of humainty.<br />

IMPORTANCE OF OUTDOOR GAMES IN THE LIFE OF A TEENAGER<br />
By Ravi / Raveena, Sports Secretary In this age, when teenagers are suffering from obesity, outdoor activities form an important part of their life. These outdoor activities have long-term benefits on their health. Adequate outdoor activity increases health and physical development by improving sensory development, reducing obesity and stimulating blood cells.<br />
These outdoor games can ward off health problems. These also inculcate in them the fighting spirit and team spirit and hence, the teenagers learn the importance of setting goals, pursuing them and achieving them. This boosts their self-esteem and their social behaviour improves. They learn to adjust with others and work in team. They also learn ’to make strategy to win. Self talk, positive thinking and visualisation help them stay above the pressures of the game and make them win.<br />
Outdoor names also give a sense of freedom. Teenagers feel that they can do and achieve anything in life. In this age, where children are so tech-savy, it might be challenging for parents to push them for outdoor games but these games help them in the overall development of their personality.</p>

NOBODY BELIEVES A LIAR<br />
Bunya was a foolish boy who was an attention seeker. He was a woodcutter and would go deep into the jungle to cut trees. One day, he wanted to do an act of mischief. He shouted at the top of his voice, &#8220;There&#8217;s a tiger, tiger, there&#8217;s a tiger &#8221; The farmers in the neighbouring area heard the voice and his cries for help. They left all of their work and came running to help the boy. When they came to the spot, they did not see any sign of a tiger.</p>
<p>The farmers asked the boy, &#8220;Was it you who cried for help? Where is the tiger?&#8221; The boy laughed and said, &#8220;I was just having fun. There is no tiger here. Go away.&#8221; The farmers got very angry. They scolded the boy and went away.</p>
<p>Next day, the boy played the same trick and thus, annoyed the farmers once again. A few days later, a tiger came there for real. The boy was petrified. He climbed up a tree. He looked here and there helplessly and shouted for help but the farmers in the nearby areas felt that he was trying to befool them again. So there came no help. Everybody was irritated by his foolish tricks. Finally, the tiger killed the boy.<br />

THE UGLY FACE OF ELECTRIC CURRENT<br />
On Sunday, I was watching TV. Suddenly, I heard people shouting outside. I got up to peep out of the window to see what had happened. To my horror and surprise, I saw a boy clinging to an electric pole. People were shouting and asking him to leave it. But he could not get off from the pole and was continuously electrified. If anybody tried to touch him, he too got the current. His mother was utterly shocked and was crying. People were trying various things to help him but all went in vain. Then came a wise man. He understood the situation. He immediately called the electricity board and told them to switch off the lights from the main board. As soon as the action was taken, the young boy fell off. He was unconscious. Immediately, he was rushed to the hospital. Then the crowd scattered. I could not believe that touching a pole could be so dangerous. But I learnt a lesson to be careful of the electric current.</p>

(iv) What difficulty do the crew of the space probe face on the Earth?<br />
(v) What was the most fascinating thing that Valli saw on the street?<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Kisa Gotami was devastated by the death of her only son. When, Buddha asked her to bring a handful of mustard seeds from a house where people had not lost a loved one to’ death, her futile search for such a house made her realise the bitter truth that everything in this world is subject to death.

<p>Question 10.<br />
Attempt the following questions in 100-120 words: [8]<br />
Bholi is a child different from others. This difference makes her an object of neglect and laughter. Elaborate.<br />
OR<br />
The poet in the poem, &#8216;For Anne Gregory&#8217; conveys that we should given importance to the inner beauty and not to the physical appearance. Elaborate with reference to the poem.<br />
Answer:<br />
Bholi is not able to speak clearly. She stammers when she speaks. She has pock marks on her face. She is neither pretty nor street-smart. She has a fear which does not let her mingle with others. That is why she is different from others. But the society does not tolerate difference easily. No one likes her and she becomes an object of neglect and laughter. They all ridicule her and make fun of her. As a result, she talks very little and has isolated herself. To add to her agony, her parents don&#8217;t treat her right. They too consider her ugly, never make new clothers for her or encourage her. Instead of supporting her and encouraging her, her mother considers her witless and calls her a dumb cow.<br />
OR<br />
In the poem &#8216;For Anne Gregory&#8217; the poet wants to convey that inner beauty is the real beauty whereas physical appearance is changeable and it is not so important. The first speaker says to her that young men love her for her beautiful yellow hair and may be they will never love her for what she really is. To this, Anne replies that her hair colour can be changed. In fact, external beauty is all superficial and men should not love her for that. Through this reply, the poet has categorically shown his preference for internal beauty over physical appearance. Physical appearance can never give a true account of a person as it can be changed with the help of clothing, make-up and other such things but inner beauth is for real and stays with the person forever.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Answer the following question in 200-250 words : [11]<br />

TRUE FRIENDS<br />
Last Sunday, I along with my friends, decided to go to the riverside for a picnic. We planned to spend the whole day there, but as luck would have it, the day turned out to be catastrophic. My friend and I set out on a boating trip. We sailed the boat smoothly and talked merrily. Soon, we noticed we were very far from the bank of the river. We were in the middle where water seemed to be very deep and flow of the river was powerful. All of a sudden the sky grew dark. A strong wind started blowing hard. The water became rough. The boat tossed up and down in the rampant water.</p>
<p>Luckily, we saw a plank floating in the water. We both jumped and caught hold of the plank. But the plank was too small to bear the weight of two. We both know that one of us should leave it otherwise both of us will drown. Then my friend said to me, &#8220;You are a married man. You must live for your wife and children. I am single. So I must go.&#8221; I was shaken to hear that. I told him that he too had a mother and a sister to take care of. But he insisted on leaving the plank and told me to take care of his mother and sister. Saying this, he let go off the plank. He was drowned.</p>
<p>After the storm was over, I reached the bank of the river. Our other friends were very worried. They were waiting for use to come back. They all turned very sad to know about his drowning. After that we all went to his home and broke the sad news to his mother and sister. They were shocked. I brought both of them to my house. My family accepted them with great love and warmth.<br />

He woke up after some time. He got upset when he saw that his box was open and the monkeys had taken away all the caps. Just then he looked up, there were so many monkeys on the tree. Each one of them had a cap on his head. The capseller was angry.</p>
<p>He picked up a stone and threw it at the monkeys. The monkeys plucked fruits from the tree and threw them at the capseller. Then, the capseller understood the trick. He knew how to get back his caps from the monkeys. They had the habit of copying others. The capseller took off the cap from his head and threw it on the ground. The monkeys also copied him. They too threw their caps down. The capseller was happy to see this. He collected the caps from the ground, put them in the box and happily went to the other village to sell them.

&#8216;HOW CAN STUDENTS KEEP FIT AND HEALTHY?&#8217;<br />
By Arun / Anita<br />
Being healthy and fit in simple terms means taking good care of the body. We should remember that a healthy mind resides only in a healthy body. Good health of both mind and body helps one maintain the required energy level to achieve success in life.</p>
<p>It is essential for students to be fit and healthy because only then they can concentrate and perform well in studies. For this, it is necessary that they protect their bodies from the intake of harmful substances. Doing regular exercise, taking proper food and sleep are the defining factors for a healthy lifestyle. Being fit will keep them away from being lethargic, restless or tired.</p>
<p>A healthy student can focus not only on studies but also on other co-curricular activities. It will bring him mental stability too.</p>
<p>A healthy diet comprising of a balance of proteins, carbs and vitamins will help in maintaining fitness and enhancing immunity level. So each student should keep health on a priority. Being happy is also directly related to boosting your mental strength and health. So happiness is also a part of a healthy lifestyle.</p>

Answer:<br />
THE DAY I GOT A NEW LIFE<br />
It was a lonely rainy day. I was enjoying a cup of tea while sitting in the balcony of my first floor apartment. Suddenly, I felt dizzy and the cup fell from my hand. I felt pain in my chest. I thought that this was the last moment of my life. I wanted to call my daughter, my husband and everyone to say the final good bye, but couldn&#8217;t do so. I was thinking of their life without me. I was worried what would happen to them if I collapsed. I prayed to God to give me some more time. I had always thought of giving a wonderful life to my daughter. Then my thoughts shifted to my husband who can&#8217;t live without me. He was used to having me around him all the time. Suddenly, a thought came to my mind, &#8216;You have to live. Get up and do something&#8217;. I tried to call but it was as if I was dumb. I knew I should not lose my wits. I should do something to keep going till my family notices me. Suddenly, I picked my mobile and dialled 102.1 don&#8217;t know what happened after that. When I came to senses, I was in a hospital room with a team of doctors bending over me. Later, I was told that I had been taken in an ambulance to the hospital in the nick of time. Any delay could have been fatal. I was happy to see my family around me. Timely treatment saved my life.<br />
OR<br />
THE BRAVE GIRL<br />
Reena, a ten-year-old girl lived in a slum with her relatives. One day when she was alone at home, a stranger knocked at the door asking for her uncle. She did not know him but let him in. It did not strike her at the moment that it could be dangerous. Her aunt came at that exact time. She too did not recognise him. She asked him to come later when her husband would be at home. He took out a knife and put it on the girl&#8217;s neck. He started threatening them to bring out all the cash and valuables. Reena made a quick plan and fell on the man&#8217;s feet pretending to plead with him. After a few seconds, she suddenly stood up, grabbed the knife from his hand and threw it out from the window. Her aunty raised an alarm and started shouting. Within no time, people from the neighbourhood gathered there. They caught him and got him arrested.</p>
