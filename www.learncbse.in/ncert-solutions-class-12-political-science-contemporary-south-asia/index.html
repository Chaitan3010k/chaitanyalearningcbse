<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Bangladesh has been the part of Pakistan itself. Both of these countries bear some similarities and differences as follows:<br />
Commonalities<br />
1. Both Bangladesh and Pakistan were under a military rule.<br />
2. At both the places, the struggle for democracy took place in their own way.<br />
3. Pakistan’s administration began under the command of General Ayub Khan and gave up due to dissatisfaction among people giving way to Yahya’s military rule and continued with the army rule though elections were held by military rulers to give a democratic shape to their own rule.<br />
4. In the same way, Bangladesh drafted its own constitution to begin with democracy. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman formed presidential setup by abolishing all the parties except Awami Legue. But after his assassination the new military ruler Zia-ur-Rahman formed his own party and won elections in 1979. Later on he was also assassinated and another military leader Lt. Gen. H.M. Ershad took over. Differences<br />
1. In Pakistan, military, clergy and land-owning aristocrats dominated socially to overthrow elected government whereas in Bangladesh the leaders and their party members dominated for the same.<br />
2. Pro-military groups have become more powerful due to conflict with India in Pakistan whereas in Bangladesh, pro-military groups are powerful due to friendship and encouragement of India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4. List three challenges to democracy in Nepal.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The three challenges to democracy in Nepal were the result of a triangular conflict between-<br />
1. the monarchist forces<br />
2. the democrats<br />
3. the Maoists<br />
These challenges created massive, countrywide, pro-democracy protest in April 2006.</p>

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Assess the positive and negative aspects of India’s relations with Bangladesh.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan from 1947 to 1971. It consisted of the partitioned areas of Bengal and Assam from British India.

Soon after the partition, they began protests against the unfair treatment meted out to the Bengali culture and language. They demanded autonomy for the eastern region. But the government dominated by the West Pakistan leadership refused their demand. The Pakistan army tried to suppress the mass movement of the Bengali people. Thousands were killed by the Pakistan army. This led a large scale migration into India, creating a huge refugee problem for India. The government of India supported the demand of the people of East Pakistan for their independence and helped them financially and militarily. This resulted in a war between India and Pakistan in December 1971 that ended in surrender of the Pakistan forces in East Pakistan and the formation of Bangladesh as an independent country.</p>

2. Pakistan’s conflict with India has made paramilitary groups more powerful which have often said that political parties and democracy in Pakistan are flawed, that Pakistan’s security would be harmed by selfish minded parties and chaotic democracy, hence army stay in power is justified.<br />

1. Pakistan bears a courageous and entirely free press.<br />
2. Pakistan enjoys strong human rights movement.</p>
