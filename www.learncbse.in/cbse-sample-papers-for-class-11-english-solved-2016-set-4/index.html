<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Section A    Reading     [20 Marks]</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8)</strong><br />
Fasting, in some form or the other, is part of every religion. In Islam, it is called ‘roza’. The Arabic equivalent of roza is ‘sawm’. Sawm literally means abstinence, i.e., to refrain from doing something. The ninth month of the Hijri calendar, i.e. Ramzan, has been especially chosen for fasting. Fasting during the month of Ramzan is obligatory for every Muslim, except when he has a genuine reason not to do so.<br />
In every human being there are two faculties to take into consideration: one is desire and the other is reason. In all matters, the individual has to decide whether to follow his desire or his reason. The great merit in fasting is that it trains us to refrain from following our desires and instead always to bow to reason. That is the spirit of sawm. According to the Prophet of Islam, one who fasts should never stoop to using abusive language; if someone abuses him, he should simply say ‘I am fasting’. Islamic fasting, as far as formal practice is concerned, is to abstain from food and drink. But the actual spirit of fasting is to refrain from indulging in negative thinking and the use of negative language.<br />
Self-control, far from being a negative or passive action, has great value in human behaviour. In life, there are more than 50% occasions when one should refrain from action and less than 50% occasions when one should take action. This is the formula for success for both individuals and society.<br />
Self-control is integral to social ethics. If you live alone on an island, there is no need for any control, as the absence of others leaves you free to do whatever you want to do. However, when you are living in a society, you have to give leeway to others. This is what every person on the road does when he drives a car: he either keeps to the left (or to the right depending upon which country he is in) so that he gives way to other cars and can carry on his journey without accidents. This principle is applicable to the entire life of an individual. It entails giving others the chance to live their lives while living one’s own life.<br />
Self-control is a kind of mutual adjustment. When a person adopts the way of self-control, it is far-reaching in effects. In this way he promotes the culture of self-control in society and indicates to others through his actions that they should follow the path that he is following. Thus, the way of self-control leads to a better society, while lack of self-control in individuals leads to the destruction of peace. As far as the individual is concerned, self-control serves as a means of personality development. This way of life, in turn, saves others from unnecessary problems.<br />
There is a ‘pre-control’ for exercising self-control and i.e., thinking. When a person adopts a life of self-control, at all times he first thinks about what path he should tread. Only after considerable thought does he plan out his course of action. A life lived in this way will necessarily be marked by creative thinking. In addition, self-control contributes to one’s intellectual development and turns one into a man of wisdom.<br />
In Islam, fasting is worship-for God. Fasting is the kind of worship which is simultaneously for the sake of God and man. Thus, if fasting is observed in the right spirit, in all sincerity, it will make an individual pious and responsible.<br />
(a) On the basis of your reading of the above passage, make notes on it using headings and sub-headings. Use recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary (minimum 4). Supply a suitable little to it.    (5)<br />
(b) Write a summary of the above passage in about 80-100 words. (3)</p>
<p><strong>2. Read the following poem carefully and answer the questions that follow. (12)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Money-Madness</strong></p>
<p>Money is our madness, our vast collective madness.<br />
And of course, if the multitude is mad<br />
The individual carries his own grain of insanity around with him.<br />
I doubt if any man living hands out a pound note without a pang;<br />
And a real tremor, if he hands out a ten-pound note.<br />
We quail, money makes us quail.<br />
It has got us down, we grovel before it in strange terror.<br />
And no wonder, for money has a fearful cruel power among men.<br />
But it is not money we are terrified of,<br />
it is the collective money-madness of mankind.<br />
For mankind says with one voice : How much is he worth?<br />
Has he no money? Then let him eat dirt, and go cold And if I have no money, they will given me a little bread,<br />
So I do not die,<br />
but they will make me eat dirt for it.<br />
I shall have to eat dirt, I shall have to eat dirt,<br />
If I have no money It is that I am afraid of.<br />
And that fear can become a delirium.<br />
It is fear of my money-mad fellow-man.<br />
We must have some money To save us from eating dirt.<br />
And this is wrong.<br />
Bread should be free,<br />
fire should be free<br />
to all and anybody, all and anybody, all over the world.<br />
We must regain our sanity about money before we start killing one another about it.<br />
It’s one thing or the other.                                                —DHLawrence<br />
<strong>(a). On the basis of your reading of the poem, answer the following questions by choosing the correct option. (1&#215;6=6)</strong><br />
(i) When does a person feel a pang?<br />
(a) Because of madness of money<br />

<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follow. (8)</strong><br />
Fasting, in some form or the other, is part of every religion. In Islam, it is called ‘roza’. The Arabic equivalent of roza is ‘sawm’. Sawm literally means abstinence, i.e., to refrain from doing something. The ninth month of the Hijri calendar, i.e. Ramzan, has been especially chosen for fasting. Fasting during the month of Ramzan is obligatory for every Muslim, except when he has a genuine reason not to do so.<br />
In every human being there are two faculties to take into consideration: one is desire and the other is reason. In all matters, the individual has to decide whether to follow his desire or his reason. The great merit in fasting is that it trains us to refrain from following our desires and instead always to bow to reason. That is the spirit of sawm. According to the Prophet of Islam, one who fasts should never stoop to using abusive language; if someone abuses him, he should simply say ‘I am fasting’. Islamic fasting, as far as formal practice is concerned, is to abstain from food and drink. But the actual spirit of fasting is to refrain from indulging in negative thinking and the use of negative language.<br />
Self-control, far from being a negative or passive action, has great value in human behaviour. In life, there are more than 50% occasions when one should refrain from action and less than 50% occasions when one should take action. This is the formula for success for both individuals and society.<br />
Self-control is integral to social ethics. If you live alone on an island, there is no need for any control, as the absence of others leaves you free to do whatever you want to do. However, when you are living in a society, you have to give leeway to others. This is what every person on the road does when he drives a car: he either keeps to the left (or to the right depending upon which country he is in) so that he gives way to other cars and can carry on his journey without accidents. This principle is applicable to the entire life of an individual. It entails giving others the chance to live their lives while living one’s own life.<br />
Self-control is a kind of mutual adjustment. When a person adopts the way of self-control, it is far-reaching in effects. In this way he promotes the culture of self-control in society and indicates to others through his actions that they should follow the path that he is following. Thus, the way of self-control leads to a better society, while lack of self-control in individuals leads to the destruction of peace. As far as the individual is concerned, self-control serves as a means of personality development. This way of life, in turn, saves others from unnecessary problems.<br />
There is a ‘pre-control’ for exercising self-control and i.e., thinking. When a person adopts a life of self-control, at all times he first thinks about what path he should tread. Only after considerable thought does he plan out his course of action. A life lived in this way will necessarily be marked by creative thinking. In addition, self-control contributes to one’s intellectual development and turns one into a man of wisdom.<br />
In Islam, fasting is worship-for God. Fasting is the kind of worship which is simultaneously for the sake of God and man. Thus, if fasting is observed in the right spirit, in all sincerity, it will make an individual pious and responsible.<br />
(a) On the basis of your reading of the above passage, make notes on it using headings and sub-headings. Use recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary (minimum 4). Supply a suitable little to it.    (5)<br />

<strong>b) Summary</strong><br />

<strong>2. Read the following poem carefully and answer the questions that follow. (12)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Money-Madness</strong></p>
<p><strong>Money is our madness, our vast collective madness.</strong><br />
<strong>And of course, if the multitude is mad</strong><br />
<strong>The individual carries his own grain of insanity around with him.</strong><br />
<strong>I doubt if any man living hands out a pound note without a pang;</strong><br />
<strong>And a real tremor, if he hands out a ten-pound note.</strong><br />
<strong>We quail, money makes us quail.</strong><br />
<strong>It has got us down, we grovel before it in strange terror.</strong><br />
<strong>And no wonder, for money has a fearful cruel power among men.</strong><br />
<strong>But it is not money we are terrified of,</strong><br />
<strong>it is the collective money-madness of mankind.</strong><br />
<strong>For mankind says with one voice : How much is he worth?</strong><br />
<strong>Has he no money? Then let him eat dirt, and go cold And if I have no money, they will given me a little bread,</strong><br />
<strong>So I do not die,</strong><br />
<strong>but they will make me eat dirt for it.</strong><br />
<strong>I shall have to eat dirt, I shall have to eat dirt,</strong><br />
<strong>If I have no money It is that I am afraid of.</strong><br />
<strong>And that fear can become a delirium.</strong><br />
<strong>It is fear of my money-mad fellow-man.</strong><br />
<strong>We must have some money To save us from eating dirt.</strong><br />
<strong>And this is wrong.</strong><br />
<strong>Bread should be free,</strong><br />
<strong>fire should be free</strong><br />
<strong>to all and anybody, all and anybody, all over the world.</strong><br />

<p><strong>5. Recently Delhi Government has proposed to ban the use of diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old. As a well-known journalist, write a speech in 150-200 words discussing the impact of the proposal. You are Venkat Rai. (10)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>You visited the Great India Place Mall, Noida, where a famous celebrity had come for the promotion of his movie. Narrate your experience in about 150-200 words. (10)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Today I, Venkat Rai, have been asked to speak about Delhi Government’s proposal of deregistering diesel vehicles that are more than 10 years old. Every new move draws both applause and anguish from the general public. It is happening with this problem also.<br />
It cannot be denied that the pollution level of the city is increasing at an alarming rate. It is majorly due to the emission of the harmful gases from diesel vehicles. It is adversely affecting the health of the people. Moreover, traffic jams have a new story to tell each day. So, something has to done urgently and banning some old cars seems a reasonable move.<br />
We blame our system for everything; so now when the system is suggesting a way to tackle the problem, people are criticising it. True, the move will prove hard for the middle class people who cannot afford a new car. But they shouldn’t come to a conclusion in haste by just hearing one half of the story. We all should wait for the final verdict of the court in this matter, as surely they will not ignore the plea of the vehicle owners.</p>

<p>Yesterday I went to Great India Place, Noida to buy a gift for a friend. I had been to the mall several times, so I knew exactly where to go. I was heading straight to the store of my choice when the lift operator asked me to wait. When I said I was in hurry, he asked to me wait and added that I would be happy to have waited. I couldn’t understand his words but didn’t argue. After a minute a team of security guards entered the lift. And to my surprise, I saw superstar Hrithik Roshan standing right in front of me. I was numb and couldn’t believe my luck. I was staring at him. He looked at me said ‘Hi’ and shook hands with me. That was an experience of a lifetime. A person whom I had earlier seen only on the silver screen was standing right in front of me.<br />
He looked very handsome in his outfit. I thanked the lift operator for giving me this opportunity. Later I came to know that he had come for the actor promotion of his upcoming movie ‘Krrish 3’.</p>

<strong>(ii) Justify the title of the story: &#8220;We&#8217;re Not Afraid to Die&#8230; if We Can All Be Together.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong>(iii) What was the reason for Zahi Hawass&#8217; worry?</strong><br />
<strong>(iv) Why was Taplow given extra work on the last day of school?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) The author had always seen his grandmother as a very old woman. For the past twenty years, he had seen her face in a criss-cross of wrinkles. She used to stoop also.Hence, it was hard for the author to believe that his grandmother was once young and pretty.<br />
(ii) “We’re Not Afraid to Die&#8230;. If We Can All Be Together” is the story of rare courage and perseverance that was shown by the narrator, his crew and his wife and children. Everybody confronted the disaster with patience, courage and determination. Like his father, Jonathan bravely said that they were not afraid to die, but it would be better if they died together. Hence, the little is logically justified.<br />
(iii) Zahi Hawass was the Secretary General of Egypt’s Sumpreme Council of Antiquities. Tut’s mummy was already in a bad condition after what Carter did to it. Hawass was scared of inflicting more damage to it. The first ever CT scan of Tut&#8217;s mummy for an accurate forensic reconstruction was arranged. When everything went as planned, he heaved a sigh of relief.<br />
(iv) Mr Crocker-Harris gave Taplow extra work on the last day of school because Taplow had missed attending classes for one day last week when he was ill.<br />
<strong>11. Answer the following questions in about 120-150 words.</strong><br />
<strong>Old people face loneliness and seclusion. Why do you think they need attention and care? How should we help them? Answer -with reference to the chapter, &#8216;The Portrait of a Lady.&#8217;          (6)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p><strong>Positive attitude helps even in the worst of situations. How does the story, &#8220;We’re Not Afraid to Die&#8230; if We Can All Be Together&#8221; help us understand this? (6)</strong><br />
<strong> Ans.</strong> Old age is the most sensitive age of a person. The old are like little infants. They are unable to do most of the things on their own. This makes them dependent on others physically as well as emotionally. This is the age when they need full support. They need someone with whom they could share everything. But sometimes, it is the loneliness that kills them from inside.<br />
The same thing happened with the narrator’s grandmother. They both are living together and were very close to each other. After some years, his parents brought them to the city where they drifted apart. But the old lady accepted her seclusion and rarely talked to anyone.<br />
This shows that the old need proper care and attention by their loved ones. They are emotionally vulnerable and want someone to be always close to them .<br />
or<br />
Whem the storm struck their boat, the captain was almost killed . The boat was nearly a wreck.<br />
He was injured, but held on to the wheel. Water was getting into the boat, but Larry and Herb kept pumping like madmen. They didn&#8217;t lose hope. Even the little girl was so brave that she didn’t inform her parents about her injuries. The little boy, an epitome of courage, said that he was not afraid of dying. All this gave the captain a new hope and a will to fight. He checked and calculated that their only chance of survival was a 65 km wide island in 150,000 square kilometres of ocean. Still they set sail towards it. Finally, they set foot on land and survived. All this shows that a positive attitude helps even in the worst of situations.</p>

<p><strong>12. The twins bring out the humour in the novel, &#8216;The Canterville Ghost.&#8217; Discuss. </strong><strong>(The Canterville Ghost) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>How did the slaves get the news about fights against slavery earlier than the whites? (Up From Slavery)             (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> In the novel, The Canterville Ghost’, Oscar Wilde transforms a horror story into a comic story. The Otis twins are lively mischievous brothers, as they enjoy playing pranks on the ghost. Instead of being scared, they scare the ghost by tripping him up, shooting peas ,at him, and even fooling him by a false ghost.<br />
The presence of a ghost in their house becomes a matter of enjoyment for them and to tease the ghost with innovative ideas. They even give evidence of their fearlessness as they climb the stairs after the ghost when the ghost escapes after dropping the heavy armour. But the twins play tricks on the ghost and make him depressed and desperate in turn. The ghost turns out to be a tragic and lonely character to be sympathised with.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Often slaves came to know of the results of great battles before the white people received it: This news was usually received from the coloured man who was sent to the post office for the mail. He would linger about the place long enough to get the drift of the conversation from the group of white people who naturally congregated there to discuss the latest news.<br />
The mail carrier, on his way back, would share the information of the important events with other slaves before it even reached the white people. The narrator recalled the hushed discussions at night. They understood the situation because of the ‘grapevine’ telegraph. This is how the slaves throughout the South, although illiterate, yet were accurately informed about the great national questions agitating the country.</p>
<p><strong>13. How does Oscar Wilde picturise the Americans in his novel? (The CanterAlle Ghost) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>Give a brief character sketch of General Samuel C Armstrong. (Up From Slavery)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> The Canterville Ghost&#8217; is a parody on the American culture as Oscar Wilde has aptty placed an American family in a British setting through a series of mishaps. Lord Canterville, the previous owner of the house, warns. Mr Otis that the ghost of Sir Simon de Canterville has haunted it ever since he has killed his wife lady Eleanore, many years ago. But Mr Otis dismisses the ghost story as merely an example of British traditionalism. But when the Otises realise that it is indeed haunted, they tease the ghost with several pranks.<br />
Oscar Wilde has satirised American materialism but he also pokes fun at English traditionalism. Mrs Umney faints at the roar of the thunder and Washington’s removal of the bloodstain ends up in laughter while Mr and Mrs Otis practical solutions also become equally laughable.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>General Samuel C Armstrong was the head of Hampton school. He was to Booker one of the noblest, rarest human beings he had even met. He was very unselfish and worshipped by his students because he was determined to uplift the blacks. He has the most dominant influence in Booker’s life. General Armstrong was also a of finances source when Booker’s Tuskegee Institute needed his help. He never took credit for what he had accomplished. He was as anxious about the prosperity and the happiness of the white race as the black. He cherished no bitterness against the South and was happy when an opportunity offered for manifesting his sympathy. He believed in the importance of industrial education for the coloured race. He very much admired what Booker accomplished and expressed a wish to spend the last few months of his life with him at Tuskegee.</p>
