<p>Question 7.<br />
How do you think that the chronicles commissioned by the Mughal Emperors are an important source for studying Mughal history ? [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Chronicles commissioned by the Mughal Emperors are an important source to study the empire and its court. They were written in order to project a vision of an enlightened kingdom to all those who came under its umbrella. The authors of Mughal chronicles focused on events related to life of the rulers their family, the court and the nobles, wars and administrative systems.</p>
<p>(ii) These chronicles were written in Persian. This language flourished as a language of the court and of literary writings, alongside North Indian languages, especially Hindavi and its regional variants. The Mughals were Chagtai Turks by origin, Turkish was their mother tongue.</p>
<p>(iii) Rulers wanted to ensure that there was an account of their rule for posterity. The histories that the authors of Mughal chronicles wrote focused on events centered on the ruler, his family, the courts and nobles, wars and administrative arrangements,</p>
<p>(vi) Akbar Nama, ShahjahanNama, Alamgir Nama suggest that in the eyes of their authors the history of the empire and the court was synonymous with that of the emperor.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Examine the events that took place during 1920s and 1930s which consolidated the communal identities in the country. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
The events that took place during 1920s and 1930s that further consolidated the communal identities in the country are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>An important development came in 1906 with the formation of the All India Muslim League at Dhaka.</li>
<li>Muslims were angered by ‘Music— before-mosque’. The playing of music by a religious procession outside a mosque at the time of namas^ could lead to Hindu-Muslim violence.</li>
<li>The Congress won an absolute majority in five out of eleven provinces and formed governments in seven of them.</li>
<li>Hindus were angered by the rapid spread of ‘tabligh’ (Propaganda) and tanzim (Organization) after 1923.</li>
<li>Middle class publicists and communal activists sought to build greater solidarity within their communities, mobilising people against the other community.</li>
<li>Hindu Mahasabha defines Hindu identity in opposition to Muslim identity.</li>
<li>Separate Electorate 1909 for Muslims expanded in 1919, created temptations to use sectarian slogans and divided society.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Describe the different arguments made in favour of protection of depressed classes in the Constituent Assembly. [4]<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>N. G. Ranga , a socialist leader argued that real minorities were the poor and down trodden. They needed protection, props and ladder through constitutional rights.</li>
<li>Some members of depressed castes emphasized that that problems of “untouchables “could not be resolved through protection and safeguard alone. Their disabilities were caused by the social norms and moral values of caste society.</li>
<li>Society had used their services and labour but kept them at a social distance such as refusing them to enter into temples and mix or dine with them.</li>
<li>J. Nagappa pointed out that numerically the depressed castes formed between 20 to 25 percent of the total population were not a minority. Their sufferings were due to their systematic marginalization not their numerical insignificance. They had no access to education, no share in the administration.</li>
<li>Ambedker advocated/recommended the abolition of untouchability. The Constituent Assembly finally recommended that untouchability be abolished, Hindu temples be thrown open to all ca&#8217;Stes, and seats in legislatures and jobs in government offices be reserved for the lowest castes.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 10.<br />
“Gandhiji was as much a social reformer as he was a politician. He believed that in order to be worthy of freedom, Indians had to get rid of social evils such as child marriage and untouchability. Indians of one faith had also to cultivate a genuine tolerance for Indians of another religion—hence his emphasis on Hindu-Muslim harmony.”<br />
In the light of the statement, highlight the values upheld by Mahatma Gandhi.&#8221; [4 × 1 = 4]</p>

<p>Question 11.<br />
Explain the agricultural practices followed by the cultivators to increase productivity from c. 600 BCE to 600 CE. [8]<br />
OR<br />
Explain the main features of the Mauryan administration.<br />
Answer:<br />
One such strategy was the shift to plough agriculture,with spread in fertile alluvial river valley such as those of the Ganga and Kaveri from 6<sup>th</sup> century BCE. The iron tipped ploughshare was used to turn the alluvial soil areas which had high rainfall. Transplantation was the strategy used for paddy cultivation in area- where water was plentiful. Broadcasting of seeds was used in paddy cultivation. While the iron plough share let to the growth in agricultural productivity, its use was restricted to certain parts of the subcontinent cultivators in areas which were semi-arid, such as parts of Punjab and Rajasthan did not adopt till the twentieth century, and those living in hilly tracts in the north-eastern and central parts of the subcontinent practiced hoe agriculture which was much better suited to the terrain.</p>
<p>Another strategy adopted to increase agricultural : production was the use of irrigation, through wells<br />
and tanks, and less commonly, canals: Communities as well as individuals organised the construction of irrigation works. The latter, usually powerful men including kings, often recorded such activities in inscriptions. A new type of strategies named ‘Land ‘ grants’ were adopted by ruling lineages to extend agriculture to new areas.<br />
OR<br />
The main features of the Mauryan administration are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>There were five major political centres in the empire—the capital Pataliputra and the provincial centres of Taxila, Ujjaini, Tosali and Suvarnagiri.</li>
<li>It was likely that administrative control was strongest in areas around the capital and the provincial centres. These centres were carefully choosen, Taxila and Ujjaini being situated on important long distance 1 trade routes, while Suvarnagiri was important for tapping the goldmines of Karnataka.</li>
<li>Communication along both land and water routes was vital for the existence of the empire. Journeys from the centre to the provinces could have taken weeks not months. These meant arranging provisions as well as protection of those who were, on the move. The army was important to ensure security and safety.</li>
<li>Megasthenese mentions a committee with six sub-committees for coordinating military activity. Of<br />
these, one looked after the navy, the second managed transport and provisions, third was responsible for , foot soldiers, the forth for horses, the fifth for the chariots and the sixth for elephants.</li>
<li>The activities of the second committee were rather varied arranging bullock carts to carry equipment, procuring food for the soldiers and fodder for animals and recruiting servants and assistants to look after the soldiers.</li>
<li>Ashoka also tried to hold his empire together propagating Dhamma, the principles of which were simple and virtually universally applicable. This would ensure the well being of the people.</li>
<li>He recruited special officers known as Dhamma Mahamattas. It was their duty to spread the message of Dhamma.</li>
<li>According to Megasthenes—Officers were appointed to different work. Such as some superintended the rivers, measure the land; inspect the sluices by which water is let out from the main canals into branches, so everyone may have equal supply of it. Some officers collect the taxes.</li>

<p>Question 12.<br />
Identify the relationship between the Sufis and the State from the eighth to the eighteenth century.<br />
OR<br />
Identify the relationship of the Alvars and Nayanars of Tamil Nadu with the State from the eighth to the eighteenth century. [8]<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The group of Sufis-the Chishtis, who migrated to India in the late twelveth century adopted the local environment and maintained an influencing relationship with the state.</li>
<li>One of the major feature of the Sufis was austerity including maintaining distance from worldly power. However, they did not maintain the complete isolation from political power.</li>
<li>The Sufis accepted unsolicited grants and donations from political elites. The sultans in turn set up charitable trusts (auqaf) as endowments for hospices and tax-free land (inam).</li>
<li>The Chishtis accepted donations in cash and kind. Rather than accumulate donations, they preferred to use these fully on immediate requirements such as food, clothes, living quarters and ritual necessities (such as sama).</li>
<li>Akbar visited Ajmer Dargah of Khawaja Muinuddinchisti fourteen times to seek blessings for new conquets, fulfilment of vows and the birth of sons. Each of his visits was celebrated by generous gifts, which were recorded in Imperial documents.</li>
<li>Kings did not simply need to demonstrate their association with sufis; they also required legitimation from them.</li>
<li>When the Turks set up the Delhi Sultanate, they resisted the insistence of the ulama on imposing shari’a as state law because they anticipated opposition from their subjects, the majority of whom were non-MuslimsT The Sultans then sought out the sufis—who derived their authority directly from God—and did not depend on jurists to interpret the shari’a.</li>
<li>In spite of this there were some instances of conflicts between Sufis and the Sultan, because both wanted to ascertain their authorities by emphasising on certain rules and regulations. Such ritual includes kissing of feet and prostration.</li>
<li>Sometimes the Sufi Shaikhs were also adorned with high sounding titles. E.g., Nizamuddin Auliya adorned the title of Sultan U1 Mashaikh (literally, Sultan among Shaikhs).</li>
</ol>
<p>OR</p>
<ol>
<li>Alvars were devotees of Vishnu and Nayanars were devotees of Shiva.</li>
<li>Chola rulers supported Brahmanical and Bhakti traditions. Royal patronage was granted to Nayanars.</li>
<li>They tried to claim the divine support and with this motive they built magnificent Shiva temples at Chidambaram. Thanjavur and Gangaikandaholapuram.</li>
<li>In these temples, bronze made sculptures of Lord Shiva were kept and known as Nataraj.</li>
<li>Chola ruler Prantaka I consecrated metal images of saints of Shaivism—Appar, Sambandar and Sundarar.</li>
<li>Krishna I, a Rashtrakuta ruler, who built Kailash temple at Ellora, also granted for the construction of many temples. These rulers not only popularised the hymns of Shiva but also made a great contribution in the compilation of Tevaram.</li>
<li>The chola rulers often attempted to claim divine support and proclaim their own power and status by building splendid temples and metal sculpture to recreate the visions of these popular saints.</li>
<li>The vellala peasants revered both Nayanars and Alvars.</li>

<p>Question 13.<br />
“After introducing the Permanent Settlement in Bengal, the zamidars regularly failed to pay the land revenue demand.” Examine the causes and consequences of it.<br />
OR<br />
“A chain of grievances in Awadh linked the prince, taluqdars, peasants and sepoys to join &#8216; hands in the revolt of 1857 against the British.&#8221; Examine the statement. [8]<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The initial demands were very high arguing that the burden on zamindar would gradually decline as agricultural production expanded and price rose.</li>
<li>A high demand was imposed in 1790s when the agricultural prices were depressed. This made difficult to pay their dues to zamindar.</li>
<li>The zamindars could not collect rent and pay the rent.</li>
<li>Revenue was in variable, regardless of the harvest and had to be paid punctually. As per sunset law, the payment had to be paid before sunset. If not done, the zamindari was liable to be auctioned.</li>
<li>The permanent settlement limited the power of zamindar to collect rent from the ryot.</li>
<li>The Company recognized zamindars as important but wanted to control and regulate them.</li>
<li>Zamindars lost their power to organize local justice and local police.</li>
<li>Rent collection was a perennial problem. Sometimes bad harvest and low prices made payments of dues difficult for ryots.</li>
<li>Sometimes ryots deliberately delayed payments but the zapiindar could not assert his power over them.</li>
<li>Rich ryot, village head man, Jotedars and Mandals were happy to see the zamindars in trouble.</li>
</ol>
<p>OR<br />
A chain of grievances in Awadh linked the prince, taluqdars, peasants and sepoys to join hands in the revolt of 1857 against the British.</p>
<p>(i) The Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah was removed by Dalhousie on the pretext of poor governance. It was looked down upon by the people as high insult to them. The local people sympathised with the Nawab. Thus, the public sentiment was gainst the British government that got a vent during the revolt.</p>
<p>(ii) The British land revenue policy further undermined the position and authority of the taluqdars. After annexation, the first British revenue settlement, known as the Summary Settlement of 1856, was based on the assumption that the taluqdars were interlopers with no permanent stakes in land. The Summary Settlement proceeded to remove the taluqdars wherever possible. The increase of revenue demand in some place was 30 to 70%. Thus taluqdars were not happy with the annexation.</p>
<p>(iii)</p>
<ul>
<li>British land revenue officers believed that by removing taluqdars they would be able to settle the land with the actual owners of the soil.</li>
<li>They thought they will be able to reduce the level of exploitation of peasants while increasing revenue returns for the state. But this did not happen in practice.<br />
The revenue flows for the state increased but the burden of demand on the peasants did not decline. Thus neither taluqdars nor peasants had any reasons to be happy with the annexation.</li>
</ul>
<p>(iv) The grievances of the peasants were carried over into the sepoy lines since a vast majority of the sepoys were recruited from the villages of Awadh. For decades the sepoys had complained of low levels of pay and the difficulty of getting leave. The relationship of the spoys with their superior white officers underwent a significant change in the years preceding the uprising of 1857.</p>
<p>(v) In the 1840s, the officers developed a sense of superiority and started treating the sepoys as their racial inferiors, riding roughshod over their sensibilities. Abuse and physical violence became common and thus, the distance between sepoys and officers grew. .</p>
<p>(vi) The company introduced a new catridge for its soldiers. It was to be bitten before use by soldiers. It was reported that it was made of the fat of cow and pig. Hence, soldiers of both Hindu and Muslim thought that it was a conspirary of the Company to destroy their religion.</p>
<p>(vii) During the early phase of the company rule, British soliders and officers had friendly relation with the Indian soldiers. Things changed after 1835 and British began to consider themselves as superior. All senior positions in the army were given to them and even at the same ranks Britishers were paid more. The native soliders were treated with disrespect.</p>

<p>Question 5.<br />
What do you know about the authors and the period when Mahabharata was compiled ? Explain. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
There are so many views about the author of Mahabharata. Following views have been put forward regarding the authorship of Mahabharata : It is believed that the original story was written by the charioteer-bards known as Sutas. They originally accompanied Kshatriya warriors to the battlefield and composed poems celebrating their victories and other achievements. It is also believed that the beginning text of Mahabharata was orally circulated. Scholars and priests carried it from one generation to another.</p>
<p>From the 5<sup>th</sup> century BCE, the Brahmanas took over the story and started writing. This was the time when Kurus and Panchals were gradually becoming Kingdoms. This story of Mahabharata also revolved around them. Some parts of the story reflect that old social values were replaced by the new ones. c. 200 BCE and 200 CE is another phase in the composition of the Mahabharata. During this period worship of Vishnu was gaining ground. Krishna came to be identified as Vishnu. Large didactic sections resembling Manusmriti were added during the period between C 200 and 400 CE. These interpretations made the Mahabharata an epic consisting of 100,000 verses. This enormous composition is traditionally attributed to a sage named Vyasa.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
“India had a unique system of communication during the fourteenth century.” Examine the statement of Ibn Batuta. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
Ibn Batuta arrived India in the 14th century. He was much impressed by the Postal System of India. Two kinds of postal system were prevalent in the society. These two systems, the horse-post called the Uluq and foot-post called the Dawa. Uluq had their station at every four miles, while the foot-post had three stations per mile and a dawa meant one-third of a mile. The foot system was much spread than the horse system and was prevalent in the entire subcontinent. It is because of this efficient postal system the rulers were able to keep a strict watch over the vast empire. The ruler used to get all the information about all the events in the minimum possible time. It took nearly 50 days to travel from Sindh to Delhi, whereas, the spies of the king were able to send their news reports in just five days through this efficient system of post. This also proved beneficial for the traders since it enabled them to despatch their goods in a short period of time.</p>

“The granting of titles to the men of merit was an important aspect of Mughal polity.” Explain. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
Grand tides were adopted by the Mughal emperors at the time of coronation or after a victory over an enemy. High-sounding and rhythmic, they created an atmosphere of awe in the audience when announced by ushers (naqib). The granting of titles to men of merit was an important aspect of Mughal polity. A man’s ascent in the court hierarchy could be traced through the tides he held. The title Asaf Khan for one of the highest ministers originated with Asaf, the legendry minister of the prophet king Sulaiman (Solomon). The title Mirza Raja was accorded by Aurangazeb to his two highest ranking nobles, Jai Singh and Jaswant Singh. TMef could be earned or paid for.

<ol>
<li>The revenue system that was introduced in the Bombay Deccan came to be known as the ryotwari settlement. The revenue was directly settled with the ryot.</li>
<li>The average income from different types of soil was estimated, the revenue-paying capacity of the ryot was assessed and a proportion of it fixed as the share of the state.</li>
<li>The lands were resurveyed every 30- years and the revenue rates increased. Therefore, the revenue<br />
demand was no longer permanent.</li>
<li>It was based on Ricardian ideas.</li>

<li>During the 1820s the revenue that was demanded was so high.</li>
<li>In areas of poor soil and fluctuating rainfall, the problem was particularly acute. When rains failed and harvests were poor, peasants found it impossible to pay the revenue.</li>
<li>However, the collectors in charge of revenue collection were keen on demonstrating their efficiency and pleasing their superiors. So, they went about extracting payment with utmost severity.</li>

<li>Biting those bullets would corrupt their caste and religion. They were referring to the cartridges of the Enfield rifles which had just been given to them.</li>
<li>The British tried to explain to the sepoys that this was not the case but the rumour that the new cartridges were greased with the fat of cows and pigs spread like wildfire across the sepoy lines of North India.</li>
<li>In the third week of January 1857 a “low-caste” khalasi who worked in the magazine in Dum Dum had asked a Brahmin sepoy for a drink of water from his lota. The sepoy had refused saying that the “lower caste’s” touch would defile the lota.</li>

religion of Hindus and Muslims. To this end, the rumours said, the British had mixed the bone dust of cows and pigs into the flour that was sold in the market.</li>
<li>There was fear and suspicion that the British wanted to convert Indians to Christianity.</li>
<li>The response to the call for action was reinforced by the prophecy that British rule would come to an end on the centenary of the Battle of Plassey, on 23 June, 1857.</li>

<li>According to the Manusmriti, the paternal estate was to be divided equally amongst sons after the death of the parents, with a special share for the eldest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Examine the significance of enclosing agricultural land within the fortified area of the city of Vijaynagar. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
Agricultural tracts were incorporated within the fortified area. The objective of medieval sieges was to starve the defenders into submission. These sieges could last for several months and sometimes even years. Normally rulers tried to be prepared for such situations by building large granaries within fortified areas.</p>
<p><strong>Part &#8211; B</strong></p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Explain how you will prove that the text of Mahabharata was a dynamic one. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
Mahabharata is a dynamic text:</p>
<ol>
<li>The growth of the Mahabharata did not stop with the Sanskrit version.</li>
<li>Over the centuries, versions of the epic were written in a variety of languages through an ongoing process of dialogue between peoples, communities, and those who wrote the texts.</li>
<li>Several stories that originated in specific regions or circulated amongst certain people found their way into the epic. At the same time, the central story of the epic was often retold in different ways.</li>
<li>Episodes of Mahabharata were depicted in sculpture and painting.</li>
<li>They also provided themes for a wide range of performing arts—plays, dance and other kinds of narrations.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Examine why Bernier described the Mughal towns as the ‘Camp Towns’. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
During the seventeenth century about 15 percent of the population lived in the towns. This was on average, higher than the proportion of urban population in Western Europe in the same period. In spite of this, Bernier described the Mughal cities as ‘Camp towns’, by which he meant towns that owed their existence and depended for their survival, on the imperial camp. He believed that these came into existence when the imperial court moved in and rapidly declined when it moved out. He suggested that they did not have viable social and economic foundations but were dependent on imperial patronage.</p>
<p>Bernier was drawing an over simplified picture. There were all kinds of towns : manufacturing towns, trading towns, port-towns, sacred centres, pilgrimage towns, etc. Their existence is an index of the prosperity of merchant communities and professional classes.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
How do you think that Qandahar remained a bone of contention between the Mughals and the Safavids ? Explain. [4]<br />
Answer:<br />
There was a constant effort by the Mughal policy to ward off this potential danger by controlling strategic outposts &#8211; notably Kabul and Qandhar. Qandahar was a bone of contention between the Safavids and the Mughals. All conquerors who sought to make their way into the Indian subcontinent had to cross the Hindukush to have access to north India. The fortress town had initially been in the possession of Humayun, reconquered in 1595 by Akbar. While the Safavid Court retained diplomatic relations with the Mughals, it continued to stake claims to Qandhar. In 1613, Jahangir sent a diplomatic envoy to the court of Shah Abbas to plead the Mughal case for retaining Qandhar but the mission failed. In the winter of 1622 a Persian army besieged Qandhar. The ill-prepared Mughal garrison was defeated and had to surrender the fortress and the city to the Safavids.</p>
