<p><strong>                                                            SECTION A-Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">1    Earlier considered an exotic ingredient, mushrooms are now common in both households and eateries. While the button mushrooms are commonly found in local markets, connoisseurs are now dishing out recipes that include imported varieties such as truffles, porcini, enoki and chanterelles. Apart from their high nutritional content, mushrooms can add a lot of flavour to both Indian and continental dishes as they can be cooked in a variety of ways from sautes to stir-fries to an Indian dish.</span><br />
<span class="font1">2To identify the expensive porcini mushroom, look for the firm brown ones that have no spots or pale  </span><span class="font1">undersides. Their contours resemble the typical mushroom that is commonly featured in children&#8217;s nursery  </span><span class="font1">rhyme books. They are available in both fresh and dry form and have a concentrated taste. They inject the </span><span class="font1">dish with a woody, pungent flavour and can be used in soups and risottos.</span><br />
<span class="font1">3 The Enoki variety is characterized by a fruity aroma. Its long, thin stems can be eaten raw, peppered with </span><span class="font1">some lemon juice, salt and pepper. When cooked it can be blended with spices like oregano, basil, and even  </span><span class="font1">nuts and fruits. Other exotic varieties like the Shimeji are characterised by thin stems, light brown caps and </span><span class="font1">can be added to soups, and sauces.    </span><br />
<span class="font1">4 The common button mushroom, is firm to the touch and are available in plenty. In their raw state they </span><span class="font1">exhibit a snow-white exterior but once they mature or ripen,they turn a brown shade, and are then called </span><span class="font1">the Swiss mushroom or Portobelloo variety. It is a good source of the energy boosting Vitamin B and also </span><span class="font1">as selenium, copper, potassium and is high in fibre and nutrients. The mushroom pancake or a stuffed risotto is a surefire sellout for breakfast with the family.</span><br />
<span class="font1">5 Irrespective of which mushroom variety one might choose to purchase, it is necessary to buy them from a good vegetable vendor. Also their delicate texture makes cleaning them a chore but they must be thoroughly washed before use. Eating cooked mushroom is a better option than eating them raw. Not only does this increase their nutritive index but also removes toxins from them.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">(a)    Cite two reasons why mushrooms are a popular addition to the Indian diet.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(b)    In what ways can the porcini mushroom be identified?    </span><br />
<span class="font1">(c)    Which variety of mushroom can be eaten raw?  </span><br />
<span class="font1">(d)    What are the ingredients used when cooking it?  </span><br />
<span class="font1">(e)    When are button mushrooms referred to as Swiss mushrooms?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(f)    What are the nutritional benefits found in button mushrooms?   </span><br />
<span class="font1">(g)    Which variety of mushroom adds a woody flavour to soups and risottos?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(h)    What precautions must be taken with mushrooms?  </span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">1 Do you remember the last time you laughed out loud? For most of us laughing out loud is an uphill task.</span><span class="font1">More often than not people think that they have no time to laugh. There are more important things to do.</span><span class="font1">But if you ask Jean Leggett, the Canadian founder of Bootcamp she&#8217;ll say you do not have anything more important to do than just laugh. Says Sudha Chandra, who attended a bootcamp: &#8216;My life was joyless. Hiring a laughter coach changed my perspective towards life. I learnt to record my emotions and ensured that the four elements of joy &#8211; dancing, laughing, singing and playing &#8211; helped to build an emotional reserve.&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="font1">2    The cynic in us may still think it is an exaggeration, but the fact is that we can be taught to laugh more. Neuroscientist Jodi Deluca says it doesn&#8217;t matter why you laugh. Even in small doses, laughter improves the quality of life. You can condition people to feel more positive as laughter opens up the mind and frees the creative juices. It makes us more receptive to new ideas. The New York-based laughter coach Beth Bongar says that since our everyday lives are full of stresses, in her classes on laughter she uses the &#8216;gibberish&#8217; technique where everyone laughs by using gibberish sounds. Such playful exercises help to reduce inhibitions and shyness and convert simulated laughter into unconditional laughter.</span><br />
<span class="font1">3    According to the greatest laughter therapists laughter is a cathartic process which helps rebalance the chemistry of emotions which can be a keynote for healing. Several researchers on the benefits of laughter in Japan have shown that laughter therapy is an efficient, low-cost, medical treatment that cuts health costs. According to their findings laughter is a stimulant that triggers energy inside a person&#8217;s DNA, potentially helping to cure disease. When we are laughing with other people, we share a sense of connectedness which in turn reduces loneliness. Says comedian Vir Das: &#8216;When 3000 people laugh at me during my performance, even if I&#8217;ve had a bad day, I feel joyful. Not everyone can be a comedian, but we can all learn to be more joyful.&#8217;</span><br />

<p><strong>                                        SECTION A-Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">1    Earlier considered an exotic ingredient, mushrooms are now common in both households and eateries. While the button mushrooms are commonly found in local markets, connoisseurs are now dishing out recipes that include imported varieties such as truffles, porcini, enoki and chanterelles. Apart from their high nutritional content, mushrooms can add a lot of flavour to both Indian and continental dishes as they can be cooked in a variety of ways from sautes to stir-fries to an Indian dish.</span><br />
<span class="font1">2To identify the expensive porcini mushroom, look for the firm brown ones that have no spots or pale  </span><span class="font1">undersides. Their contours resemble the typical mushroom that is commonly featured in children&#8217;s nursery  </span><span class="font1">rhyme books. They are available in both fresh and dry form and have a concentrated taste. They inject the </span><span class="font1">dish with a woody, pungent flavour and can be used in soups and risottos.</span><br />
<span class="font1">3 The Enoki variety is characterized by a fruity aroma. Its long, thin stems can be eaten raw, peppered with </span><span class="font1">some lemon juice, salt and pepper. When cooked it can be blended with spices like oregano, basil, and even  </span><span class="font1">nuts and fruits. Other exotic varieties like the Shimeji are characterised by thin stems, light brown caps and </span><span class="font1">can be added to soups, and sauces.    </span><br />
<span class="font1">4 The common button mushroom, is firm to the touch and are available in plenty. In their raw state they </span><span class="font1">exhibit a snow-white exterior but once they mature or ripen,they turn a brown shade, and are then called </span><span class="font1">the Swiss mushroom or Portobelloo variety. It is a good source of the energy boosting Vitamin B and also </span><span class="font1">as selenium, copper, potassium and is high in fibre and nutrients. The mushroom pancake or a stuffed risotto is a surefire sellout for breakfast with the family.</span><br />
<span class="font1">5 Irrespective of which mushroom variety one might choose to purchase, it is necessary to buy them from a good vegetable vendor. Also their delicate texture makes cleaning them a chore but they must be thoroughly washed before use. Eating cooked mushroom is a better option than eating them raw. Not only does this increase their nutritive index but also removes toxins from them.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">(a)    Cite two reasons why mushrooms are a popular addition to the Indian diet.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(b)    In what ways can the porcini mushroom be identified?    </span><br />
<span class="font1">(c)    Which variety of mushroom can be eaten raw?  </span><br />
<span class="font1">(d)    What are the ingredients used when cooking it?  </span><br />
<span class="font1">(e)    When are button mushrooms referred to as Swiss mushrooms?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(f)    What are the nutritional benefits found in button mushrooms?   </span><br />
<span class="font1">(g)    Which variety of mushroom adds a woody flavour to soups and risottos?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(h)    What precautions must be taken with mushrooms?  </span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font1">(a)    Mushrooms have a high nutritional content, can be cooked in a variety of ways and add flavour to both Indian and continental food preparations.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(b)    The porcini mushroom resembles the mushroom pictured in nursery rhyme books. Availabe both fresh and dried, the best picks are the firm, brown ones minus any spots or pale undersides.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(c)    The enoki variety of mushrooms can be eaten raw, garnished with salt, pepper and lemon juice.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(d)    When cooking enoki mushrooms one must blend it with oregano, basil, and even nuts and fruits.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(e) Button mushrooms are referred to as Swiss mushrooms when they mature or ripen and acquire a brown shade.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(f) Button mushrooms are a source of the energy boosting Vitamin B and also contain selenium, copper, potassium. It is high in fibre and nutrients.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(g) The porcini mushroom adds a woody and pungent flavour to soups and risottos.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(h) Mushrooms should be bought from a good vegetable vendor, be carefully and thoroughly washed and cooked to remove toxins from them.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">1 Do you remember the last time you laughed out loud? For most of us laughing out loud is an uphill task.</span><span class="font1">More often than not people think that they have no time to laugh. There are more important things to do.</span><span class="font1">But if you ask Jean Leggett, the Canadian founder of Bootcamp she&#8217;ll say you do not have anything more important to do than just laugh. Says Sudha Chandra, who attended a bootcamp: &#8216;My life was joyless. Hiring a laughter coach changed my perspective towards life. I learnt to record my emotions and ensured that the four elements of joy &#8211; dancing, laughing, singing and playing &#8211; helped to build an emotional reserve.&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="font1">2    The cynic in us may still think it is an exaggeration, but the fact is that we can be taught to laugh more. Neuroscientist Jodi Deluca says it doesn&#8217;t matter why you laugh. Even in small doses, laughter improves the quality of life. You can condition people to feel more positive as laughter opens up the mind and frees the creative juices. It makes us more receptive to new ideas. The New York-based laughter coach Beth Bongar says that since our everyday lives are full of stresses, in her classes on laughter she uses the &#8216;gibberish&#8217; technique where everyone laughs by using gibberish sounds. Such playful exercises help to reduce inhibitions and shyness and convert simulated laughter into unconditional laughter.</span><br />
<span class="font1">3    According to the greatest laughter therapists laughter is a cathartic process which helps rebalance the chemistry of emotions which can be a keynote for healing. Several researchers on the benefits of laughter in Japan have shown that laughter therapy is an efficient, low-cost, medical treatment that cuts health costs. According to their findings laughter is a stimulant that triggers energy inside a person&#8217;s DNA, potentially helping to cure disease.

<span class="font1">Through the columns of your esteemed daily, I wish to bring to the notice of the citizens the congesting of colony roads due to residents parking vehicles on them. This practice has narrowed vehicular movement space, swallowed pedestrian walkways, led to massive traffic jams during rush hour, and the slowing of traffic. As increasing road area is not feasible, citizens are urged to stop purchasing more personal transport </span><span class="font1">arid</span><span class="font1"> utilise public transport.</span><br />
<span class="font1">As these residents are employees of corporate offices their companies should run bus services to reduce the use of private cars. Such measures will reduce fuel consumption, enhance environmental benefits as fewer vehicles on roads will reduce incidence of asthma and flu, ensure lower pollution and noise levels in cities.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Freeing of space along roads will make way for better patrolling by the authorities thereby reducing chances of accidents, providing traffic management and upgrading quality of living for residents.</span><br />

by Preeti<br />
<span class="font1">The final examinations for all classes in our school saw a rare sight Several students&#8217; desks remained empty all through the tests as these children were absent from school due to illness. Added to the. misery of having to lie in bed and swallow bitter pills, was the added tension of not knowing whether they would be promoted to the next class.</span><br />
<span class="font1">This unfortunate incident brings to light the fact that examinations should not be the only criterion for promotion. The students&#8217; year-round performance needs consideration so as to assess the child in alternate ways.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Alongside year-round assessment, project work done in school and initiatives taken by the student should also be a criterion for promotion.</span><br />
<span class="font1">With such measures in place, examinations will cease to be the kind of bug bear it has become today.</span></p>

<strong>Ans.    </strong>                                                      <strong>   <span class="font2">The Message</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">The British officer was newly posted to the battalion at Meerut. He was gruff and demanding and did not even speak the language of his men. He abused them when irritated and had slapped Naik Mangal during the morning parade and ordered him to be locked up in the quarter guard. The other soldiers had resented his treatment of Mangal, but when Subedar Sahib had tried to reason with Captain Howard, he had simply used foul language and yelled.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Clearly, their minds were made up. The British must leave India and soldiers must stage a mutiny to this effect. The plot was hatched. The whole country was to be informed by messaging. The battalion cook made four chapattis which were then blessed by the battalion pandit, He asked four of his men going on leave to take it with them, make four more each and distribute to four others. In this way, the message reached the ears of Nana Sahib, the Peshwa, and he agreed to lead the mutiny.</span><br />
<span class="font1">On the fateful afternoon of 10 May, 1857, at 3.00 pm, the men of the Bengal Regiment left their barracks and marched to Delhi, declaring the start of the First War of Independence,</span><br />

<span class="font2">                                             <strong>    Lock Thief Seeks Police Help</strong></span><br />
<span class="font1">Beli Ram, a local locksmith, was the one people turned to when they forgot their keys and wanted to enter their house or when their cupboards jammed. Few knew of Beli Ram&#8217;s secret ambition of making a lot of money by fair means or foul and that is why he dreamt of breaking open a cash vending machine. He found an ideal one in an abandoned factory building. It was in a dark alley and while it was busy during daytime, no one came to it at night.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Beli Ram kept a sharp lookout and when the guard had loitered off for a while, leaving the machine unguarded, Beli Ram quickly ventured in and made his way to the backroom, where the machine was attached to the cash container. Wasting no time he tried to pry open the screws but instead of unlocking the precious booty, the doors got jammed. The lights went off and Beli Ram began to feel breathless. In sheer desperation he tried calling the police, but the place did not receive any signal.</span><br />
<span class="font1">In the meantime, automatic alarm signals sounded at the head office in Mumbai. Matters came to rest when the police, &#8216;rescued&#8217; a near unconscious Beli Ram from the clutches of the very machine he had tried to pick.</span></p>

<p><strong><span class="font1">9. </span><span class="font1">Answer any </span><span class="font1">four </span><span class="font1">of the following questions </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font1">30-40 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">(a)    Why is Decius more successful in persuading Caesar than Calpurnia is?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(b)    Why did the poet hit the snake with a log?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(c)    What was Lavinia&#8217;s reaction when she saw the Ghost in her husband&#8217;s room?</span><br />
<span class="font1">(d)    What do you know about Patol Babu&#8217;s days as a stage performer?    &#8211;</span><br />
<span class="font1">(e)    In what way did the villagers connive with Mrs. Packletide in shooting the tiger?</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font1">(a) Brutus told Caesar that Calpurnia&#8217;s dream was a fortunate one. He said that people washing their hands </span><span class="font1">in Caesar&#8217;s blood suggested that Caesar would infuse a new life and energy into the Romans. He also told Caesar that the Senators had made up their minds to crown him and in case he wouldn’t go, they would kill him.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(b)When the poet saw the snake going back into its dark hole he was agitated. Moreover, his education had </span><span class="font1">taught him that snakes are venomous creatures and it could kill too. So, the poet was dehumanized for a moment and he hit the harmless snake.    ”</span><br />
<span class="font1">(c)    Hallock had thought that Lavinia would faint on seeing a ghost but when she saw Helen, there was a smile of satisfaction on her face and she said to the ghost. &#8220;I thought you were Helen of Troy. She was happy that her husband was not cheating upon her.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(d)    During his stay in Kanchrapara, outside Calcutta, Patol Babu was a well known stage actor. He could not think of anything but acting. He was a known actor in jatras, amateur theatricals and in plays put up by the club in his neighborhood. On countless occasions his name appeared in handbills. It was no exaggeration, that people used to buy tickets to see Patol Babu.</span><br />
<span class="font1">(e)    Although the villagers knew that Mrs Packletide&#8217;s bullet had killed the goat and the tiger had died of shock, they readily connived to twist the truth for fear of losing the thousand rupees promised for procuring an aged tiger that could be shot without much fuss.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font1">A</span><span class="font1">low that miracle has happened&#8230;</span><br />
<span class="font1">At that moment, the woman&#8217;s hand moved.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Sebastian Shultz&#8217;s mother said&#8217; &#8220;All that we knew was that we needed a miracle.&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="font1">Our prayers are often heard and there are miracles which change the course of our life. After reading the story, you felt that miracles do happen. Narrate any such event of your life that was miraculous and which totally changed the course of your life.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Or</span><br />
<span class="font1">Discuss the various themes of the poem &#8216;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#8217;.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font1">God is omnipresent and omnipotent. His presence can be felt in the little miracles which happen every day in our lives. But we don&#8217;t pay much attention to those little things and don&#8217;t realise that God is listening to all our prayers. One such miracle happened to me also. A purse snatcher snatched my purse and ran away. I had a lot of money , my mobile phone, my I-card and many of my A.T.M. cards in it. I cried uncontrollably and told the passers-by about the incident. One of the passers-by said, &#8220;I know you are distressed but don&#8217;t worry just pray to God and you will get back your purse.&#8221; And, unbelievably when I went back home distressed my Mom told me that there was a call from the police station and that they had caught a gang of snatchers and among the things recovered from them, was my purse also. My happiness knew no bounds. I rushed to the police station to find that all the things in my purse were intact. I was really happy. I thanked the man who had told me not to get distressed and pray to God.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Or</span><br />
<span class="font1">There are various themes involved in the poem The first one is the connection to the spiritual world. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#8221; occurs in the natural, physical world-the land and ocean. However, the work has popularly been interpreted as an allegory of man&#8217;s connection to the spiritual, metaphysical world. In the epigraph, Burnet speaks of man&#8217;s urge to &#8220;classify&#8221; things since Adam named the animals. The Ancient Mariner shoots the Albatross as if to prove that it is not an airy spirit, but rather a mortal creature; in a symbolic way, he tries to &#8220;classify&#8221; the Albatross. Like all natural things, the Albatross is intimately tied to the spiritual world, and thus begins the Ancient Mariner&#8217;s punishment by the spiritual world by means of the natural world The next theme is retribution. The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#8221; is a tale of retribution, since the Ancient Mariner spends most of the poem paying for his one, impulsive error of killing the Albatross. The spiritual world avenges the Albatross&#8217;s death by wreaking physical and psychological havoc on the Ancient Mariner and his shipmates. Even before the sailors die, their punishment is extensive; they become delirious from a debilitating state of thirst, their lips bake black in the sun, and they must endure the torment of seeing water all around them while being unable to drink it for its saltiness. Eventually the sailors all die, their souls flying either to heaven or hell.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font1">11. Do you think that Mr. Frank was protective and concerned about Anne? Discuss.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Draw a character sketch of Margot Frank.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font1">Mr Frank was protective towards Anne. He advised her not to meet Peter frequently. He often supported her during arguments. He could not take a stand when Mrs. Frank expressed a strong opinion. He was a very nice man and loving father. He was deeply concerned about the safety and security of his family. He understood Anne very </span><span class="font1">well. He discussed important matters with her. He read books to her and Margot. He was a loving father who </span><span class="font1">never rebuked his children. He was upset when Anne didn&#8217;t listen to his advice and kept meeting Peter. He could understand that Margot was close to her mother but Anne looked for support in him. So, he always supported her and explained things to her in a logical manner. Anne sees her father, Otto Frank, as a kindred spirit. Like Anne, Otto is a perpetual student, inhaling books, history, and news, and he encourages these interests in Anne. Also like Anne, he is a clown, frequently trying to amuse those around him and lighten up the mood of the Annex. Unlike young Anne, Otto seems to be basically even-tempered and eager for peace in every situation.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 13.3333px; line-height: 20px;">Or</span><br />
<span class="font1">Margot Frank was Anne&#8217;s sister and was three years elder to her. She was born in Frankfurt in 1926. She was quite good at academics and Anne thought she was liked a lot by Mummy and all the others. According to Anne, she was pretty, beautiful and intelligent. It seems that Anne didn&#8217;t have a strong bond with Margot. Margot died at </span><span class="font1">Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, a few days before Anne died in that concentration camp. She was very obedient </span><span class="font1">and compromising, so she was a natural favourite with the elders in the hideout. Margot was quiet while her sister was talkative and blunt to a fault. She was a poor eater and was often checked by Mrs. van Daan about it, but Margot did not react to such remarks. Margot was targeted to be picked up by the Gestapo and that forced the family to go into hiding earlier than scheduled.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font1">                                                                  Part B</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font1">11. Do you find the book &#8216;The Story of My Life&#8217; by Helen Keller inspiring? Elucidate.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font1">Draw a character sketch of Arthur Keller. </span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font1">&#8216;The Story of My Life&#8217; is a book which inspires every person to achieve his goal in life despite difficulties. Helen was a brave girl who never submitted during the tough times. She fought with her destiny and emerged as a winner. Her world was dark and gloomy. She found herself lonely and suffered a lot of pain when she felt that people didn’t understand her. She saw a hope in Miss Sullivan. With her support and her sheer hard work and determination, she moved ahead and achieved success. An ordinary man would have given up but not Helen. So, the book inspires us to be hardworking, sincere and courageous so that we can achieve the impossible. Helen Keller is one of the most memorable women in history. Despite being blind as well as deaf, she learned to communicate and lived a life devoted to helping others. Her faith, determination, and spirit helped her to accomplish far more than many people expected. In fact, she won the admiration of famous figures from all over the world.</span><br />
<span class="font1">Or</span><br />
<span class="font1">Arthur H. Keller was a captain in the confederate army. He was also the editor of a north Alabama newspaper. He was a loving and indulgent father. He loved his family a lot. He was fond of hunting and it was the only time when he was away from his family. He was nature-loving and his homestead was his pride. He brought Helen closer to </span><span class="font1">nature.</span><span class="font1"> He took her from tree to </span><span class="font1">tree and</span><span class="font1"> he loved Helen a lot. He </span><span class="font1">did</span><span class="font1"> everything he could to</span><span class="font1">help</span><span class="font1"> Helen speak. He made a lot of efforts to get a competent teacher for Helen. He died of a heart attack when Helen was just sixteen.</span></p>
