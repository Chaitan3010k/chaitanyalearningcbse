Sub: Difficulties faced by the common man due to rise in prices<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to express my deep concern in the increasing rise of prices of basic commodities.<br />
Today the prices of basic commodities especially edible items like pulses, onions, oils and other products necessary for the common man has increased exponentially. A few years ago, the prices of basic edible items were low enough for a person to survive on. However, the same item has increased by around 30%, making it difficult for many families to survive. This leads to families either foregoing a meal a day or choosing to end their lives because there is no end to the dark tunnel. The blind eye of the government towards these issues has not helped, infact it has resulted in the death of many. While increase in prices may show that our country is doing financially well but at the cost of scores of people who have to miss their daily nourishment.<br />
To solve this problem, the authorities need to take prompt actions to resolve this issue. , One such solution may be providing these subsidies at a lower prices for the lower- income families and having the same items sold at a higher cost for those who can afford the same. Another solution may be to provide the grain at an optimum price that is affordable by all but this may require thorough government planning. It is necessary that the government takes stringent action to ensure that every person meet their nutritional needs for the day. Without the support of a strong people-friendly policy, the common man will have to continue to suffer with an empty stomach.<br />
I am hopeful that you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to bring to the attention to the authorities the difficulties faced by the common man in purchasing even the basic food items necessary for their day to day living.<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
Pranjal/Praneeta<br />

GOOD MANNERS<br />
By xyz<br />
Good manners are basic etiquettes that need to be imbibed by all as a man&#8217;s manners are a mirror in which he shows his portrait. Practicing good manners makes a person desirable at home by their family members and in society. If a man or woman from any background or any financial condition has good manners, they are always accepted and appreciated by everyone.</p>
<p>Good manners can be one of the reasons for success in a person&#8217;s academic or professional career. The reason behind this rationale is that good manners helps a person imbibe the positive attributes of time management and punctuality, which goes a long way in moulding one&#8217;s personality. People are always attracted to an individual with a good heart and good manners. &#8216;Thank You&#8217;, &#8216;Sorry&#8217; and &#8216;Please&#8217; are the three magical words, which form the pillars of good manners. If someone offers you something or some kind of favor or praises you, then you should say &#8216;Thank You&#8217;. If you want to ask or want any kind of favor from others then before starting your sentence you should say &#8216;Please&#8217;. If you hurt someone whether it is intentional or by mistake, you should say &#8216;Sorry&#8217;. A well- mannered person attracts more goodwill than an ill-mannered one. By being polite, humble and kind, you will always makes a place in everyone&#8217;s heart.</p>

Answer :<br />
A SURPRISE VISITOR<br />
We just moved into our new house in the beautiful hills of Dehradun. Winters were cold and dark. Being the first night, I found it difficult to take rest due to the excitement.</p>
<p>I seemed to be the only one awake reading my new comic book, while rest of the family members were sleeping soundly. It was extremely cold and chilly so I cuddled myself firmly in my blanket.</p>
<p>At first, I thought I was imagining things when I heard a thudding sound. I felt that is was just my imagination running wild, but when the sound came again for the second and then the third time, I was sure it could not be ignored. I got up from my bed and as I switched on the light, the sound stopped.<br />
I could hear the footsteps in the kitchen. I picked up the torch lying on my bedside table and walked nervously towards the kitchen. With hurried footsteps, I followed the noise albeit nervously.</p>
<p>As soon as I opened the kitchen door, I heard a crash. I switched on the lights, immediately. My parents were also awakened by the noise. On the floor was a glass bowl of milk smashed into pieces. We looked behind the counter and saw two shiny innocent eyes looking back at us. The culprit was the cutest Labrador puppy one could ever find. He walked up to me and licked my face in apology. We realized that he must have got into the house lost and frightened. Since, there was no collar round his neck, I begged my parents to keep him. Seeing the cold and snow outside, they relented. Now, this doggy of mine is my best friend who never leaves my side.<br />
OR<br />
JUST A LITTLE LUCK<br />
The date of the final examinations was declared. I was very upset as I already knew I would have to leave home much before the scheduled time as my examination center was quite far. Being in a prime location, I realized that there would be a lot of traffic on the way to the examination center.<br />
On the day of exam, I was horrified when my friend called and informed me that the entire main road had been blocked due to an accident and there was a long traffic jam. I was extremely perplexed and tensed. My parents told me to relax and assured me that they would drop me to the examination center. Fortunately, my father knew another route that we could take, though it was much longer. We took the route but reached , the examination center late. The exam had ’ already begun. I was tensed. The examiner told me rush to my seat and begin writing my paper.</p>
<p>I rushed to my seat and I breathed a sigh of relief after reading the question paper as I knew most of the answers. I was able to complete the paper on time. I came out of the examination hall, happy and content. I saw my parents waiting for me. When the result were declared, I stood first in the class. I was happy as my hard work paid off.</p>

Sub: Unhygienic living conditions in Laxmi Nagar<br />
Respected Sir,<br />
I am a local resident of Laxmi Nagar. I, through your esteemed newspaper, would like to bring to the notice of the concerned authorities the unhygienic living conditions prevalent in our area due to the on-going strike of the Municipal Corporation of Delhi employees.<br />
The employees who collect garbage have been on strike for the last two weeks, which has only resulted in an extensive pile of garbage being accumulated at the edge of the<br />
road. This pile has led to a lot of breeding of mosquitoes in the filthy water and is home to rats. This has become a health hazard to the people of the area. There are already twelve cases of dengue and malaria which have been reported, out of which one is a seven- year-old girl who is fighting for her life in the intensive care. The stink of the garbage has made living in the area unbearable. Our once beautiful locality has now turned into a dumping ground from hell.<br />
I would be grateful to you if you could help us in bringing this concern in front of the authorities responsible for the upkeep so that the situation can be controlled.<br />
Yours truly,<br />

IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION IN PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT<br />
By Miki/Manish<br />
Many people still think that personality is related to the physical appearance of a person. If a person is well-built and wearing a good dress, it is said, that he/she has a good personality. But this is not a rational approach. As a person&#8217;s true personality can be noticed through the way he communicates with others.</p>
<p>The purpose of education is to develop knowledge, skills and shape the character of a person. Education does not only provide knowledge and skills but also imparts values, and helps cultivate the right attitude and habits. It is necessary for physical, mental and social development. It helps in honing one&#8217;s character through discipline. The aim of education is to inspire and motivate an individual to think, evaluate and act.</p>
<p>Through co-curricular activities, one can pick up necessary skills and values. Good manners that are a part of education can also be honed and aid a person in becoming a responsible and productive person. Education helps to improve the capability and the personality of an individual.</p>

On my way to school, I usually see a beggar on the roadside. Yesterday on my way back, I did not see him there. Walking further, I saw him limping slowly. Out of idle curiosity I followed him. Soon I found him walking straight as soon as he entered an alley, he was talking to three other men who were shabbily dressed. They were talking in hushed tones and I sensed something womg. I remembered seeing a police van parked on the main road, I walked quickly and told the policeman whatever I had seen. The Senior Inspector told me to wait with one of the lady constables while they went to the spot where I saw the beggar. It took them a while to return, but when they returned, the beggar and the other three men were in handcuffs. The Senior Inspector then told me that the beggar was actually a thief with a gang responsible for the recent spate of robberies in the area. The injury was caused while he was trying to enter a house through a broken window. The gang managed to escape before an alarm was rung by the watchman of the society. That was the day I learnt not to jude a book by its cover.<br />

AN UNFORGETTABLE PICNIC<br />
It was a Sunday afternoon. We had gone for a picnic to a park. Suddenly, I noticed that my seven-year-old sister was missing from the group. We went in search of her in the woods and shouted out her name but there was no reply from her. Everyone started to panic especially my mother. We soon informed the park ranger and then divided ourselves into smaller groups and continued our search. My mother and my aunt went back to the picnic spot just in case she returned. We searched for nearly two hours as the sun was going to be set.</p>
<p>The park ranger got a message on his radio transceiver from his colleague that they had found a seven-year-old girl sleeping under a tree with a golden retriever standing as a guard by her side. We all rushed to the spot. I ran and woke my sister up, the park ranger told us that it was good that our pet dog had accompanied her else she could have become a prey to the wild animals. We then told the ranger that it was not our pet, and soon discovered that the dog was abandoned by his owners. My father carried my sister in his arms and said that we would take care of the dog from now on. My sister did not understand much of what had happened and was confused about all the fuss. One good thing that came out of this adventure was that my sister found herself a new best friend.</p>

IMPORTANCE OF CLEAN SURROUNDINGS IN YOUR LOCALITY<br />
By Ram/Rama<br />
Throughout our childhood, we have been learning that &#8216;Cleanliness is next to godliness&#8217;. Cleanliness is one of the most important habit for human being in order to live a healthy and happy life. It is a best quality everyone needs to have or develop with time. Following cleanliness helps us in keeping our body and mind very energetic, active, fresh and healthy. It keeps us away from the diseases which is the most important thing. Even the government through its &#8216;Clean India mission&#8217; tries to present a clean and green country. We know that every household generates waste or garbage, we can do our bit by throwing waste or garbage only in trash bins. Throwing garbage all over the place will only make our surroundings dirty and pollute the environment. Controlling the use of plastic bags will also help to keep our surroundings clean. One should use recycled and eco¬friendly products such as paper or jute bags instead of plastic bags.<br />
Throwing of plastic bags by the roadside only makes our surroundings dirty and unhygienic. Plastic bags are not biodegradable. They also clog the drains and cause water logging. Do not litter on the road or in your neighbourhood. Littering causes land, air and water pollution. Try planting trees and plants that will beautify our surroundings as well as keep us healthy. Greener surroundings look beautiful and also reduce pollution to keep us fit and healthy, soilling our surroundings will only cause harm to us. So, keep the surroundings clean and live a healthy life. This will result in a pollution free and safe environment.</p>

BE CAREFUL OF THE FRIENDS YOU MAKE<br />
Once upon a time, a monkey lived on a mango tree beside a lake. He used to throw ripe mangoes into the lake which a crocodile ate. The crocodile became a great friend of the monkey. They often chatted as they ate mangoes. The crocodile was nice but he was continuously nagged by his wife. He always took some mangoes home under the water for his wife.</p>
<p>One day, the crocodile told the monkey that his wife was very pleased with the mangoes and she had asked the crocodile to bring his friend to her. &#8220;Please, friend, accept my request. Come to our house with me. My wife wants to meet you. She is very grateful to you&#8221;. The monkey said, &#8220;But how can I go into water? I cannot swim!&#8221; The crocodile told him that he should simply sit on his back and hold on to him. &#8220;Trust me. You will not drown &#8220;, said the crocodile.</p>
<p>So, one day the monkey sat on the back of the crocodile. He asked his friend to swim on the surface for some time. During this ride, the crocodile, who was very simple, told the monkey that his wife wanted to eat the heart of a monkey. The monkey was scared to hear this, but he did not express his fear. He cleverly told the crocodile, &#8220;I am sorry, friend, I have left my heart on the tree. Take me back; I will take it for your wife.&#8221; The foolish crocodile swam back. As soon as he reached the bank, the monkey jumped off * his back, and climbed up the tree. &#8220;Good bye, friend!&#8221; he said from above, &#8220;your wife will never taste a monkey&#8217;s heart!&#8221; And this proved that we should always be careful while making friends.<br />

It was a hot summer&#8217;s day. A thirsty crow flew into a village in search of water. The crow flew over the houses, fields, and trees. But he didn&#8217;t find any water. After a long time, he came across a farm. Under one of the trees on the farm was a pitcher of water. Happy that he found some water finally, he swooped down to the tree and then down to the ground.</p>
<p>He quickly moved towards the pitcher and looked inside. There was very little water in the pot. The crow put his beak inside the pitcher but could not reach the water. The water level was too low and the narrow opening prevented his neck from going all the way down. He tried to push the vessel down to let the water out, but it was too heavy. The crow was disappointed.</p>
<p>He was really thirsty and needed to drink the water badly. He could have given up and<br />
flown to another farm, looking for water. But he didn&#8217;t. Instead, he looked around and thought, &#8220;What else can I do?&#8221; He saw that there were a lot of pebbles on the farm. And, he had an idea! He collected a pebble and put it into the pitcher. As he added more and more pebbles the water level came up to the brim. The crow drank the water and flew back home happily!</p>
