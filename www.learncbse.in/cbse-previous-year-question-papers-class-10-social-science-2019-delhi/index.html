OR<br />
Interpret the contribution of French in the economic development of the Mekong Delta region.<br />
Answer:<br />
In the economic sphere, &#8216;Liberalism&#8217; stood for the freedom of markets and the abolition of state-imposed restrictions on the movement of goods and capital. Duties were levied according to the weight or measurement of the goods which were different for different states. Liberalisation meant reduction of custom , duties and removal of these quotas. A unified economic territory allowing the unhindered movement of goods, people and capital was the need of the hour. In 1834, Zollverein, a customs union abolished tariff barriers and reduced the number of currencies from over thirty to two. This was the main concept of Liberalisation prevalent in the 19th century in Europe.<br />
OR<br />

Later, it settles down in the surrounding areas which retards the process of infiltration of water into the soil. This is how land gets degraded due to Cement industries.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
How can democratic reforms be carried out by political conscious citizens? [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
The most important concern should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens. Politically conscious citizens are aware about their duties and rights as entitled by the constitution, this gives them an upper hand for they are able to judge between right and wrong. They are also able to spread this awareness around by holding discussions or generally through the word of mouth and help in formation of Public opinion. Politically aware citizens have better knowledge of diplomacy and world politics.</p>

Secondary Sector: It covers those activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through manufacturing. This is the next step after primary activity.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Why do banks or lenders demand collateral against loans? [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
Collateral is something of value &#8211; an asset or property that the borrower pledges when getting a loan, such as land, building, vehicle etc.. This is used as a guarantee by the lender until the loan is repaid. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, the lender is free to sell the collateral and reimburse his amount. Thus collateral acts like a guarantee against loan.</p>

How had Napoleonic code exported to the regions under French control? Explain with examples. [3 × 1 = 3]<br />
OR<br />
Explain with examples the three barriers that are responsible to economic growth in Vietnam.<br />
Answer:<br />
Napoleonic code:</p>
<ul>
<li>It did away all privileges based on birth.</li>
<li>It established equality before the law.</li>
<li>It secured the right to property.</li>
<li>Abolished feudal dues.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through a return to monarchy, Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed democracy in France, but in the administrative field he had incorporated revolutionary principles in order to make the whole system more rational and efficient. In the Dutch Republic, Switzerland, Italy and Germany, Napoleon simplified administrative divisions, abolished the feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild restrictions were removed. Transport and communication systems were improved. Peasants, artisans, workers and new businessmen enjoyed a new-found freedom. Businessmen and small-scale producers of goods, in particular, began to realise that uniform law, standardised weights and measures, and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another.<br />
OR<br />
There were several barriers to economic growth in Vietnam:</p>
<ul>
<li>High population level in Vietnam hindered the growth of the country.</li>
<li>Another was low agricultural productivity. To reduce rural poverty and increase agricultural productivity it was necessary to carry out land reforms as the Japanese had done in the 1890s. But sufficient employment could not be generated as expected.</li>
<li>Extensive indebtedness among the peasants because of less funds.</li>
<li>The French colonialists did little to industrialise Vietnam and in the rural areas, landlordism spread and the standard of living declined.</li>

How had the Imperial State in China been the major producer of printed material for a long time? Explain with examples. [3 × 1 = 3]<br />
OR<br />
How had novels been easily available to the masses in Europe during nineteenth century? Explain with examples.<br />
Answer:<br />
From AD 594 onwards, books in China were printed by rubbing paper &#8211; also invented there against the inked surface of woodblocks. The imperial state in China was, for a very long time, the major producer of printed material. China possessed a huge bureaucratic system which recruited its personnel through civil service examinations.</p>
<p>Textbooks for this examination were printed in vast numbers under the sponsorship of the imperial state. From the sixteenth century, the number of examination candidates went up and that increased the volume of print. By the seventeenth century, as urban culture bloomed in China, the uses of print diversified. Reading increasingly became a leisure activity. Women, revolutionaries, poets and even merchants used print in everyday life.<br />
OR<br />
Novels have been easily available to the masses in Europe because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invention of Printing Press and other technological advancements were mainly responsible for the growing popularity of novels in Europe.</li>
<li>Development in means of transportation and communication made it possible to send the copies of novels all over the Europe.</li>
<li>Setting up of public libraries or lending libraries made novels easily accessible.</li>

<p>Question 11.<br />
&#8220;Water scarcity may be an outcome of a large and growing population in India.&#8221; Analyse the statement. [3 × 1 = 3]<br />
Answer:<br />
A large population requires more water not only for domestic use but also to produce more food. Hence, to facilitate higher food-grain production, water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas for dry-season agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the largest consumer of water. Post independent India witnessed intensive industrialization and urbanization, creating vast opportunities for us. Today, large industrial houses are as commonplace as the industrial units of many MNCs.</p>
<p>The ever-increasing number of industries has made matters worse by exerting pressure on existing fresh water resources. Industries, apart from being heavy users of water, also require power to run them. Much of this energy comes from hydroelectric power. Most of these have their own groundwater pumping devices to meet their water needs, which results in fragile water resources being overexploited. This has caused their depletion in several of these cities.</p>

Answer:<br />
The assertion of social diversities in a democratic country is very normal and can be healthy because:</p>
<ul>
<li>This allows various disadvantaged and marginal social groups to express their grievances and get the government to attend to them.</li>
<li>Expression of various social diversity results in their cancelling one another out and thus reducing their intensity.</li>
<li>They also help to uplift the marginalised or deprived section of society which also leads to strengthening of democracy.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
Yes, social division affect politics in following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>It strengthens the idea of communal politics.</li>
<li>Government mainly supports the majority community, by denying the rights of minority community.</li>
<li>Politics of social division is very normal and can be healthy, it allows people to express their grievances.</li>
<li>Its outcome depends on how people perceive their identity, or how political leaders raise their demands, and it depends on how the government react to demands of different groups.</li>

<p>Question 13.<br />
&#8220;Women still lag much behind men in India despite some improvements since independence.&#8221; Analyse the statement. [3 × 1 = 3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Women still lag much behind men because men are in authority over women in all aspects of the society. The evidences are :<br />
(i) Political participation of women in India very is less when compared to other countries. Only 10% of the total members in Lok sabha are women. The situation is worse in state assemblies where only 5% of the total members are women. The Women reservation bill to encourage the participation of women is still pending since past decade.</p>
<p>(ii) Women have entered into every field but they are still paid less than their male counterparts. The proportion of women in highly paid jobs is still less and studies have showed that on average they work more than men and yet paid less. Although the Equal Remuneration Act provides provision for equal wages should be paid for equal work.</p>
<p>(iii) The literacy rate amongst the women is also low as compared to men. The literacy rate is only 54% as compared to 76% among the men. This shows the discrimination women have to face. Men are still considered to be the head of the family. A lot of dowry issues still emerge everywhere. Men are known to dominate women in every field using strength as a factor. Women are made to stay quiet even in cases of rapes, betrayal etc.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
How are political parties recognized as regional and national parties in India? Explain with examples. [1\(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) + 1\(\frac { 1 }{ 2 }\) = 3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Democracies that follow a federal system all over the world tend to have two kinds of political parties : parties that are present in only one of the federal units and parties that are present in several or all units of the national level. Every party in the country has to register with the Election Commission. Parties that get a unique symbol and some other special facilities are &#8216;recognized&#8217; by the Election Commission for this purpose. That is why these parties are called, &#8216;recognized political parties&#8217;. A party that secures at least six percent of the total votes in an election to the Legislative Assembly of a State and wins at least two seats is recognized as a &#8216;State Party.&#8217; A party that secures at least six percent of the total votes in Lok Sabha elections or Assembly elections in four states and wins at least four seats in the Lok Sabha is recognized as a &#8216;National party.&#8217;</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
&#8220;Consequences of environmental degradation do not respect national or state boundaries.&#8221; Justify the statement. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Environment is degraded through the depletion of resources like air, water and soil. It leads to destruction of ecosystem and extinction of wildlife. It is a global issue and has been debated over a decade.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pollution in one country may effect the other in form of acid rain, climate change etc.</li>
<li>Deforestation in some countries may disturb the rainfall pattern in the surrounding countries.</li>
<li>Land degradation and dam burst can bring massive siltation and flood like situation. Thus, consequences of the actions of one state or country may affect others, this proves that environmental degradation does not respect land boundaries.</li>

<p>Question 16.<br />
Why is the &#8216;tertiary sector&#8217; becoming important in India? Explain any three reasons. [3]<br />
OR<br />
How do we count various goods and services for calculating Gross Domestic Product (G.D.P.) of a country? Explain with example.<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>First of all in any country several services such as hospitals, educational institutions, banks, transportation etc. are considered as the basic services for any developing country like India.</li>
<li>As income rises, certain sections of people start demanding more services like tourism, shopping, hospitals, schools etc. This helps in increasing the GDP of the country.</li>
<li>Over the past decade or so, certain new services such as those based on Information and communication technology have become important and essential in India. Thus, the tertiary sector becomes very important.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of the final goods and services produced during a year within the domestic territory of a country. While calculating GDP, final goods and services are counted to avoid the problem of double counting.<br />
For e.g. a farmer sold wheat to flour mill for ₹ 10 per kg. The mill grinds the wheat and sold the flour to a biscuit company for ₹ 12 per kg. The biscuit company uses the flour, sugar and butter to make 5 biscuit packets. It sold the biscuit to the consumer at ₹ 15 per biscuit packet. Here biscuits are the final goods that are purchased by the consumer. Wheat and Wheat flour are the intermediate goods used in the production of final good. The value of ₹ 75 already includes the value of flour ₹ 12. Hence, only the value of final goods and services are included in GDP.</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
Describe the importance of formal sources of credit in economic development. [3 × 1 = 3]<br />
OR<br />
Describe the bad effects of informal sources of credit on borrowers.<br />
Answer:<br />
Importance of formal sources of credit in economic development are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is monitored by the Reserve Bank of India or regulated by government of India and thus helps in bringing&#8217;order to the system of lending and borrowing in the country.</li>
<li>Provides fixed interest rate to all sections of society.</li>
<li>Limits the scope of using unfair means to repay the payment.</li>
<li>Less interest rate and accessible to all, rich or poor.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
Following are the bad effects of informal, sources of credit:</p>
<ul>
<li>They are not subordinate to any government organisation like RBI, thus there is no official backing or monitoring agency.</li>
<li>Absence of a fixed interest rate increases the scope of exploitation.</li>
<li>Increases the probability of scope of using unfair means to get back their payment.</li>
<li>Higher interest rates, with no official records, often lead to debt traps.</li>

Define the term &#8216;Civil Disobedience Movement.&#8217; Describe the participation of rich and poor peasant communities in the &#8216;Civil Disobedience Movement.&#8217;<br />
Answer:<br />
Dr. B.R. Ambedkar had organised the dalits into the Depressed Classes Association in 1930.<br />
Achievments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#8216;Depressed Classes Association&#8217; was in favour of seperate electorate for dalits.</li>
<li>It uplifted the dalits against the dominance of upper caste hindus.</li>
<li>It gave the depressed classes, reserved seats in provincial and central legislative councils in proportion to their population.</li>
<li>The &#8216;Depressed Classes Association&#8217; enhanced the dignity of marginalised section of society such as SC, ST, OBC.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
The term &#8216;Civil Disodedience&#8217; meant &#8220;Refusal by a large group of people to obey particular laws or pay taxes, usually as a form of peaceful political protest&#8221;.</p>
<p>In the countryside, rich peasant communities &#8211; like the Patidars of Gujarat and the Jats of Uttar Pradesh &#8211; were active in the movement. Being producers of commerical crops, they were very hard hit by the trade depression and falling prices. These rich peasants became enthusiastic supporters of the Civil Disobedience Movement, organizing their communities, and at times forcing reluctant members, to participate in the boycott programmes. For them, the fight for Swaraj was a struggle against high revenues.</p>
<p>Poor peasants wanted the unpaid rent to the landlord to be remitted. They joined a variety of radical movements, often led by Socialists and Communists. Apprehensive of raising issues that might upset the rich peasants and landlords, the Congress was unwilling to support &#8216;no rent&#8217; campaigns in most places. So, the relationship between the poor peasants and the Congress remained uncertain.</p>

&#8220;Industrialization had changed the form of urbanization in the modem period.&#8221; Analyze the statement with special reference of London.<br />
Answer:<br />
Indian trade has definitely played a crucial role in the late 19th century world economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Britain had a trade surplus with India, she used this surplus to balance her trade deficits with other countries.</li>
<li>Britain&#8217;s trade surplus in India also helped to pay the so-called &#8216;home charges&#8217; that included private remittances home by British officials and traders, interest payments on India&#8217;s external debts and pensions of the British officials in India.</li>
<li>In the 19th century, thousands of Indian and Chinese labourers went to work on a plantation in mines and for roads and railways construction projects around the world.</li>
<li>India also provided raw materials to the developing industries of the world.</li>
<li>India became a major market for the final goods especially for cotton textile industry of Britain.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
As the swadeshi movement gathered momentum, nationalists mobilised people to boycott foreign cloth. Industrial groups organised themselves to protect their collective interests, pressurising the government to increase tariff protection and grant other concessions. From 1906, moreover, the export of Indian yam to China declined since produce from Chinese and Japanese mills flooded the Chinese market. So industrialists in India began shifting from yam to cloth production. Cotton piece goods production in India doubled between 1900 and 1912. Yet, till the First World War, industrial growth was slow.</p>
<p>The war created a dramatically new situation. With British mills busy with war production to meet the needs of the army, Manchester imports into India declined. Suddenly, Indian mills had a vast home market to supply As the war prolonged, Indian factories were called upon to supply war needs: jute bags, cloth for army uniforms, tents and leather boots, horse and mule saddles and a host of other items. New factories were set up and old ones ran multiple shifts. Many new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hours. Over the war years, industrial production boomed.<br />
OR<br />
The textile mills in the industrial cities of Britain like Leeds and Manchester attracted migrants. By 1851, three quarters of the adult population of Manchester comprised of migrants from rural areas.<br />
(i) A huge number of skilled and unskilled workers came and settled in London to work in the industries like. Footwear, metal and engineering, wood and furniture and stationary items.<br />
(ii) In 1854, the first cotton mill was set up in Bombay and by 1921, there were 85 cotton mills where about 1,46,000 workers were employed.<br />
(iii) Between 1851 and 1931, only one-fourth of the people living in the city were bom in Bombay, rest of them had come from outside. Many of them were from Ratnagiri who had come in search of work to the Bombay hills.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
How are industries responsible for environmental degradation in India? Explain with examples. [5 × 1 = 5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Industries are responsible for environmental degradation in India by following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The presence of high proportion of undesirable gases such as sulphur dioxide, and carbon monoxide is a product of these industries. They affect the environment majorly.</li>
<li>Industrial and construction activities, machinery and factory equipment, generators, saws and pneumatic and electric drills also make a lot of noise in the environment.</li>
<li>The main culprits in this regard are paper, pulp, chemical and textile industries that let out dyes, detergents, acids, salts and heavy metals etc. with carbon, plastic and rubber into the water bodies.</li>
<li>The air-borne waste particle contains both solid and liquid particles like dust, sprays, mist and smoke which pollutes the environment.</li>

Power-sharing has emerged as a strong substitute to the idea of undivided political power, which believed in giving power to one person or group of people located in one place. The core principle of power sharing is that people are the source of all political powers. Common forms of power-sharing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vertical division of power: The sharing of power can be done at the different levels of the govt. &#8211; a central govt, for the entire country and governments at the provincial or regional level. This type is usually called the federal government.</li>
<li>Horizontal division of power: In this form, the power is divided among different organs of govt, such as the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. It places different organs of the government at the same level.</li>
<li>Power is also shared among different social groups such as religious and linguistic groups eg: community govt.</li>

<p>Question 7.<br />
Explain the importance of &#8216;collateral&#8217;. [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
Collateral is an asset, land, vehicle property or something valuable that the borrower pledges as a guarantee in return of the money he borrows from the lender. If the borrower fails to repay the money borrowed, the lender has the right to confiscate the collateral. Hence, its main importance is that it ensures the repayment of credit.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Analyse the importance of &#8216;rainwater harvesting.&#8217; [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
It is a technique of increasing the recharge of groundwater by collecting and storing rainwater by constructing structures, such as dug wells, percolation pits and check dams.</p>
<p>In most cases, the harvested water is usually redirected to storage tanks, cistern or reservoirs. First and foremost, the collection offers better and efficient utilization of energy resource. It is important because potable water is usually not renewable.<br />
The overall expenses used in setting up harvesting methods are much cheaper compared to other purifying or pumping means. Its maintenance is feasible on the economic front as it does not require deep pockets.</p>
<p>Harvesting allows the collection of large amounts of rainwater. Rainwater is usually free from harmful chemicals, which makes it ideal for irrigation purposes.<br />
Another important advantage is that it reduces the demand for potable water. It is important especially in areas with low water levels. Rainwater harvesting, thus, is considered a very reliable way to conserve water.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />

<p>(ii) Active Members: Another component of a political party are the active members who contest elections for the party and are elected as representatives. They are the ones, who<br />
climb the ladder from being the follower and become the assistants of the leaders to gain knowledge about politics.</p>
<p>(iii) Followers: The last one is the followers who support a political party and in elections make their party victorious. They are simply the ardent followers of the leaders and work under the able guidance of the active members.</p>

<p>(ii) Climate also plays a major role in the concentration of industries at a certain place. Favourable weather conditions required for the growth &amp; harvesting of the crop causes its industries to be located in certain places.<br />
For e.g. cotton textile industry are generally found in Maharastra and Gujarat because of favourable climatic conditions.</p>
<p>(iii) Availability of capital and other infrastructural facilities is also one reason. It is due to the availability of capital that Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai became big industrial centres. These places have banking facilities and well developed infrastructure.</p>
<p>(iv) Availability of both skilled and unskilled labour also governs the location of an industry. Cheap and abundant labour is one necessary condition which affects the location of an industry.</p>
<p>(v) The entire process of manufacturing is futile until the finished products reach the market and the consumers. Thus, the availability of &#8216; a good market near by also benefits the owners.</p>
<p>(vi) Government policies, peace, protection of the environment play a vital role in the location of industries.</p>

<p>Question 11.<br />
Analyse the impact of &#8216;water scarcity.&#8217; [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Water is one of the most important requirements for agriculture and also for livestock. Water is needed for irrigating the crops; thus, water scarcity immediately leads to the loss of crops. The scarcity of water damages the already sown crops. Livestock . is affected as the fodder (animal feed) production is also decreased manifolds due to water scarcity. The domestic farms need water for its proper maintenance. So, water scarcity is a threat to both these sectors. Water scarcity directly affects human beings and animals.</p>
<p>Absence of potable water for drinking and other purposes causes a lot of diseases and problems to human beings. This hinders their daily routines and they are unable to discharge their daily duties. Without access to clean water, there is no way one can avail proper sanitation facilities. Access to quality water is fundamental to better living standard &amp; economic growth. Absence of that lowers the living standards of the country. Natural landscapes suffer the most because of water scarcity as it contributes to desertification, loss of plants and death of wildlife.</p>

<p>Question 21.<br />
Explain five types of &#8216;industrial pollution.&#8217; [5 × 1 = 5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Industrial pollution creates environmental degradation in the following ways:<br />
Due to the release of undesirable gases like sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide, airborne particulate matter containing smoke, dust and spray mist, toxic gases by burning fossil fuels in the industries, Air pollution is caused. Release of these pollutants also causes Acid Rain. Thus, chemicals pollute the atmosphere and cause life-threatening diseases. This also affects monuments, buildings and animals.</p>
<p>Water pollution is caused by organic and inorganic industrial wastes discharged into the rivers, liquid wastes produced by chemical and textile industry, tanneries, petroleum refineries, electroplating industries and metallic pesticides etc. solid wastes like fly ash, phosphor-gypsum and slags produced by iron and steel industries. Water pollution leads to loss of rich aquatic life and flora-fauna. This causes water scarcity as well. This also causes diseases like typhoid and cholera.</p>
<p>All the pollutants that cause water pollution, along with wastes from nuclear power plants are responsible for land pollution. Water and land pollution are closely related. All the liquid and solid affluents, if not being disposed off into the rivers, goes directly into the soil and degrade the land areas.<br />
All the unwanted sounds caused due to industrial and construction activities, machinery, generators and drilling activities create irritants and are a source of stress.</p>
