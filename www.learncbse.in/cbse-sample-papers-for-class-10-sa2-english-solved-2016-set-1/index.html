<h3><span class="font5">                                                         SECTION A-Reading</span></h3>
<p><strong><span class="font4">1. Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font4">                                                                  <strong>   Power Foods</strong></span><br />
<span class="font3">1 When Rajat, a student studying for the Class X Board examination who had put on six kilograms, during preparation leave, approached Dr. Anoop Mishra of the Fortis Hospital, for advice, he was told that the lack of physical activity was the primary cause of weight gain. He further advised him to follow a few significant tips.</span><br />
<span class="font3">2    As Rajat&#8217;s appetite had gone up and he had begun to snack frequently, Dr. Mishra asked him to give up the habit and have small meals at frequent intervals. He was also told not to skip a meal In case, he still felt the urge to snack, he was advised to have sprouts and salads in lieu of snacks loaded with fat and eat fruit in place of snacks with refined sugars. To avoid the temptation of munching on biscuits, chips and </span><span class="font3">namkeens,</span><span class="font3"> he was advised to munch carrots, cucumber and fruits.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3    To keep up his metabolism, and be able to concentrate for longer hours on his books, he was advised to avoid heavy meals, specially late at night. He needs to expose his body to sunlight for at least fifteen minutes a day to imbibe Vitamin D, a good vitamin for regulation of weight and also for the brain.</span><br />
<span class="font3">4    When it came to cold drinks, Rajat was advised to drink toned milk and </span><span class="font3">nimbu pani</span><span class="font3"> to help him get rid of untimely hunger pangs. Also green teas he was told was a metabolic booster and could be tried out.</span><br />
<span class="font3">5    As far as his study routine was concerned, Dr. Mishra advised him to take breaks frequently instead of sitting for long hours at a stretch as that could cause headaches. In case he did get a headache it was necessary to learn what had triggered it, and then try and avoid those things. The lighting of the room and placement of the chair was also important.</span><br />
<span class="font3">6    Above all, Rajat was advised to take regular exercise, as all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font4">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    Why did Rajat approach Dr Mishra?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    What was Rajat advised to do instead of snacking?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What substitutes was Rajat advised in place of snacks?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    How was he to overcome the temptation of eating biscuits and </span><span class="font3">namkeens</span><span class="font3">?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    Why was Rajat asked to stay away from heavy meals late at night?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(f)    What kinds of cold drinks was Rajat permitted to have?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(g)    What was the cause of headache according to Dr Mishra?    </span><br />
<span class="font3">(h)    Why should we expose ourselves to sunlight for fifteen minutes every day?</span><br />
<strong><span class="font4">2. Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1. As the harvest season sets in, villagers start trickling in to the temple at Sorikampatti village, 30 km from Madurai. They seek the blessings of the deity, before beginning the daily practice of jallikattu training. The tradition of Jallikattu goes back to a legend surrounding the majestic Kangayen bull, a premium local breed and a legendary bull tamer Alagu Servai. He was poisoned to death by his fellow tamers as he had never failed in a game. His story is now part of the folklore of the region. This festival is held during harvest</span><br />
<span class="font3">festivities in mid-January. The sport derived its name from the term &#8216;salli&#8217; meaning coins, in reference to the coins tied to the raging bull&#8217;s horns that tamers tried to pocket in daring feats;</span><br />
<span class="font3">2.In recent years several cruel practices have crept in. Bull owners took to feeding their animals arrack and rubbing chilli on their bodies to make them more aggressive and the game more exciting. This had led to a growing ire among animal rights bodies who have demanded an end to this cruel sport. The tussle came to an end with the Supreme Court imposing a ban on the custom of Jallikuttu. Earlier, in 2006, the Madras High Court bench had imposed a ban on the event citing cruelty to animals. After a long-drawn-out battle between the Jallikuttu supporters and the detractors from the Animal Welfare Board in India, in 2009, the Tamil Nadu Jallikuttu Act was passed by the state government making it compulsory that the event is held under supervision of the district collector, superintendent of police and the Animal Welfare Board representatives.</span><br />

<span class="font3">5    As far as his study routine was concerned, Dr. Mishra advised him to take breaks frequently instead of sitting for long hours at a stretch as that could cause headaches. In case he did get a headache it was necessary to learn what had triggered it, and then try and avoid those things. The lighting of the room and placement of the chair was also important.</span><br />

<p><strong><span class="font4">2. Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">1. As the harvest season sets in, villagers start trickling in to the temple at Sorikampatti village, 30 km from Madurai. They seek the blessings of the deity, before beginning the daily practice of jallikattu training. The tradition of Jallikattu goes back to a legend surrounding the majestic Kangayen bull, a premium local breed and a legendary bull tamer Alagu Servai. He was poisoned to death by his fellow tamers as he had never failed in a game. His story is now part of the folklore of the region. This festival is held during harvest</span><br />
<span class="font3">festivities in mid-January. The sport derived its name from the term &#8216;salli&#8217; meaning coins, in reference to the coins tied to the raging bull&#8217;s horns that tamers tried to pocket in daring feats;</span><br />
<span class="font3">2.In recent years several cruel practices have crept in. Bull owners took to feeding their animals arrack and rubbing chilli on their bodies to make them more aggressive and the game more exciting. This had led to a growing ire among animal rights bodies who have demanded an end to this cruel sport. The tussle came to an end with the Supreme Court imposing a ban on the custom of Jallikuttu. Earlier, in 2006, the Madras High Court bench had imposed a ban on the event citing cruelty to animals. After a long-drawn-out battle between the Jallikuttu supporters and the detractors from the Animal Welfare Board in India, in 2009, the Tamil Nadu Jallikuttu Act was passed by the state government making it compulsory that the event is held under supervision of the district collector, superintendent of police and the Animal Welfare Board representatives.</span><br />
<span class="font3">3. While Jallikuttu organisers are willing to abide by the rules for holding the sport, animal rights activists</span><br />
<span class="font3">maintain that irrespective of rules and regulations, the sport cannot be held without perpetrating cruelty to the animals. They claim that cruelty is an inherent element of the sport. The men who grapple with the animals claim that a Kangayen bull is bred solely for the sport. With tractors replacing the bull jn the fields, there is no reason other than Jallikuttu to rear them. With the ban on the spprt, it is feared that soon the breed would become extinct. </span><br />

<span class="font3">While outwardly things appear idyllic, the lack of bird sound appears wanting. The park&#8217;s attendants are concerned with its depleting bird population. The koyal, a regular summer visitor has dwindled in number and the sparrow, a common sight amidst the flower beds and pathways, has disappeared altogether.</span><br />
<span class="font3">The authorities cite the over use of insecticides behind this disappearance. Cutting down of roadside trees reduces nesting spots for the birds. Several fledglings fall to the ground from the branches as this exercise is performed without regard to the nesting season. Communication towers on rooftops of adjacent homesteads have taken a toll of the sparrow population. Creating nesting places under eaves and placing water and grain containers in gardens or balconies will alter the status quo.</span><br />

<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font3">As a UN World Heritage Site, the Red Fort has become a star attraction. Scores of visitors tour various palaces, gardens, and finally stop by at the museum, before exiting the premises. The markings and placards giving briefs about each site, make it easy for visitors to independently fathom out the significance of every part of the place. But till recently, that was a privilege for the sighted alone</span><br />
<span class="font3">On International Museum Day, this oversight was duly corrected. Thus, when the Union Minister for Culture arrived to inaugurate the special exhibition curated to commemorate the 250th Anniversary of the First War of Independence, she noticed the Braille placards before every exhibit and a designated guide chaperoning such visitors. When called upon to speak on the occasion, the Minister made a special mention of the Director&#8217;s efforts to make Red Fort an inclusive tour. Byt the greatest surprise was yet to come. That year when the honours list wes published, the museum&#8217;s director was pleasantly surprised to find his name among the, Padma Shri awardees, the nation&#8217;s high-level honour for outstanding service to the nation. It was clear that the Minister had recommended his name as the citation mentioned his concern for the otherwise-abled as his outstanding achievement.</span><br />

<p><span class="font3">As a young lad Amati dreamt of becoming a great inventor, but he was too poor and uneducated to be a man of science. Hence he set off from his home to make his fortune elsewhere. He arrived in the little town of Cremona, Italy where a feast day of the local saints was being celebrated in the town square. Amati, having nothing better to do, joined the revelers and danced and sang about.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Becoming a little fatigued he decided to sit out a dance or two and took a place beside the fiddlers. His eye caught the large bass viol, from which came a loud, deep and booming sound. He soon learnt that in the town of Cremona, there was a violin maker who might take him as an apprentice.    &#8216;    ,</span><br />
<span class="font3">Amati joined him and soon began working towards making a small, portable instrument for use in public spaces to accompany dances.</span><br />
<span class="font3">He worked day and night and soon, the Viol changed into a smaller more melodious instrument which is the modern day violin. Indeed the apprentice of Cremona has given the world of music the greatest gift—a violin—that is portable along with being one of the most melodious instruments of the world.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font4">8.Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">&#8216;God save thee, ancient Mariner,</span><br />
<span class="font3">From the fiends that plague thee thus!-Why look&#8217;st thou so?&#8217; &#8211; &#8220;With my crossbow I shot the Albatross&#8221;</span><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    Who is the first speaker in this verse?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    What does the term </span><span class="font3">&#8216;fiends’</span><span class="font3"> mean?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What is the true significance of the mariner&#8217;s answer?</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Decius Brutus: Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving blood, and that great men shall press For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    What is being referred to by Decius Brutus?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    What interpretation does Decius Brutus give about the spouting of blood from the fountain?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What does the term </span><span class="font3">&#8216;relics&#8217;</span><span class="font3"> mean?</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font3">(a) The first speaker in this verse is the wedding guest who the mariner had stopped, as the guest was making </span><span class="font3">his way to the wedding party, to narrate his misfortune.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    The term &#8216;fiends&#8217; means &#8216;enemies&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    The true significance of the Mariner&#8217;s answer is that by shooting down the Albatross, that the sailors believed was a symbol of good fortune for them, the Mariner had brought on a curse upon the ship.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    Decius Brutus is referring to Calpurnia&#8217;s dream where she had seen Caesar&#8217;s statue spouting blood like a fountain and Romans bathing their hands in it.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    Decius Brutus suggests that the blbod spouting forth was revivalist in nature which would restore Rome&#8217;s glory. Great men would use the blood as the colours of their coat of arms and as a badge of service to Caesar and Rome.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    The term &#8216;relics&#8217; refers to things of the past that are preserved for their significance or importance by later generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4"><strong>9. Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each</strong>.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(a)    What do you think the poet of the poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; was a coward or a brave person?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    Do you think Caesar would not have died if he had listened to his wife and stayed at home?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    What do you come to know about Patol Babu from the chapter &#8216;Patol Babu, Film Star&#8217;?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    What genre of stories does Jenkins want the narrator to write? Why?</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    What did Mrs Packletide plan to give Loona Bimberton for her birthday? Why?</span><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font3">(a) The poet of the poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; was a cowardly person. He didn&#8217;t listen to what his heart said. He rather listened</span><br />
<span class="font3">to the voice of his education that he must kill the snake. The poet regrets his act in the end because the snake was a harmless creature and didn&#8217;t harm the poet in any way.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(b)    Yes, because the conspirators had decided to kill Caesar on that very day. They had made preparations to execute the plan of murdering Caesar accordingly on that day only. Moreover, Mark Antony was out of the city. Caesar was all alone and there was no One to defend him.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(c)    Patol Babu was a simple, ordinary man trying hard to make both ends meet. He was a talented actor who was not able to make a mark in his life. But he was happy doing whatever he was doing and living an ordinary life. He was a very committed person who did every little job assigned to him with utmost sincerity and didn&#8217;t value money much.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(d)    Jenkins wanted the narrator to write ghost stories because his ghost stories were liked by the public and were in great demand. As a publisher, Jenkins wanted to keep the people happy.</span><br />
<span class="font3">(e)    Since Loona Bimberton had captured attention by being airborne for 11 miles, Mrs Packletide decided to counter her feat by shooting a tiger, taking a harvest of photographs, for a press coverage and presenting a </span><span class="font4">tiger daw </span><span class="font3">brooch to LOona Bimberton as a birthday gift.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font4">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">Video games, internet and other hi-tech gadgets are just a part of growing up in a digital world. But parents should keep a check because excessive use of these gadgets can hamper their physical, mental, social and emotional growth. Express your ideas about the same in the form of a paragraph.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Write a paragraph on what underlying statement do you think the poet is making in &#8216;Snake&#8217; about human beings in general and himself in particular. Explain.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.<span class="font4">Value Points:</span></strong><br />
<span class="font3">•    The children today born with gadgets in their hands.</span><br />
<span class="font3">• Love to play video games and surf internet.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    Their lives revolve around these wonders of technology only.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    Children become couch potatoes.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    Physical growth is hampered as they don&#8217;t play any outdoor game.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    Mental growth is also marred as they do not interact with their peer group.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    Children don&#8217;t make friends and don&#8217;t have a social circle.</span><br />
<span class="font3">•    They are emotionally weak as they don&#8217;t share their feelings with any one.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">The poem is about an encounter between the author&#8217;s mind and heart. The poet saw a snake and admired it. He felt honoured that such a lovely creature had come to his house. The author&#8217;s inner voice told him to be kind to the snake and show his hospitality towards the snake. The author&#8217;s mind however, guided him to kill the snake as they are considered to be poisonous creatures. The author hit the snake with a log and at the disappearance of the snake regretted his action and immediately blamed himself for his action. He placed the blame on the voice of his education which had lured him into it. The author criticized himself and the whole of mankind for not believing in the unity and co-existence of man and animal and killing animals because they have incomplete knowledge about them. Animals are beautiful creatures and should not be killed.</span><br />

<p><strong><span class="font12">11</span><span class="font4">.</span>What are the views of Anne that she had mentioned in her diary about the grown-ups in the Annexe?</strong><br />
<strong> <span class="font3">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong> <span class="font3">Draw a character sketch of Mrs Edith Frank.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font3">The views in Anne&#8217;s diary are all written by her only after experiencing them according to which Anne was not happy with the attitude of the grown-ups. She calls them idiotic and stupid. Whenever she used to approach them to know anything about a matter or to be a part of the discussion, they simply used to put her off in one way or the other by saying that she should keep herself out of the conversation. She never got a satisfactory response from them. Her feelings were suppressed. She was not on good terms with her mother. Anne felt that her mother was lacking in motherly feelings and was not capable of understanding her children at all. Sometimes, she found Mrs. van Daan better than her mother. She developed the feeling that the grown-ups didn&#8217;t allow their children to form any opinion. She wanted that when children are young, they shouldn&#8217;t be prevented from saying what they think. Grown-ups should give due value and respect to the opinions of the young. In the Annexe, Elli, Margot, Peter and Anne needed great love and devotion but none could understand them.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Edith Frank is the mother of Anne Frank. Anne does not write much about her mother. She feels that her mother is not an ideal mother who could support her daughter emotionally. She feels that her mother is cold, critical, and uncaring. She feels that they have very little in common. Mrs. Frank does not know how to show love to her children. She does not have a good rapport with her children. Anne rarely comments on her mother&#8217;s positive traits. Mrs. Frank is a sentimental and critical mother. She is unable to provide emotional support to her daughter. But at times Anne realises that it was all due to the stress and pain of their persecution and forced confinement.</span></p>

<p><strong>11. Which subjects had Helen studied in 1893?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> <span class="font3">Draw a character sketch of Mildred Keller.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font3">Helen did not have any scheduled time-table for her studies. She was also not particular about any subject. Her study pattern was not selective. She studied different subjects on a hit-and-miss basis. Helen had read the histories of Greece, Rome and the United States. She had some knowledge about French. She had a French grammar in raised print and as she already knew some French, she often amused herself by composing in her head short exercises, using the new words as she came across them and ignored rules and other technicalities as much as possible. After her visit to the World Fair she become serious about her studies and followed a schedule to learn Latin and to acquire knowledge about various subjects. Miss Sullivan helped her in her efforts.</span><br />
<span class="font3">Or</span><br />
<span class="font3">Mildred Keller is the younger sister of Helen Keller. She is a sweet child who always accompanied Helen. Helen used to feel jealous of Mildred. She felt that she had taken her place as her mother&#8217;s only darling. Mildred would sit in her mother&#8217;s lap constantly and seemed to take up all her time and care. One day Helen overturned the cradle where little Mildred was sleeping peacefully. She would have been killed had it not been for their mother who caught her as she fell. In later years they grew affectionate towards each other and were content to go hand in hand everywhere although Mildred could not understand her finger language nor Helen Mildred&#8217;s childish prattle.</span></p>
