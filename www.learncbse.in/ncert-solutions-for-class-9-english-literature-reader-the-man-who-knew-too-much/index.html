<h2>NCERT Solutions for Class 9 English Literature Reader Chapter 3 The Man Who Knew Too Much</h2>
<p>Question 1.<br />
With your partner, discuss and narrate an incident about a person who likes to show off.<br />
Check whether your classmates agree with you.<br />
Answer:<br />
You can be at peace with yourself when you are true to yourself. Showing off doesn’t pay in the long run. It may impress some for some&#8217; time but not all, all the time. My friend Ramesh falls in this category. Whenever you see him, you would always find him with half a dozen books. In the class, he interrupts the teachers for one or the other reason. If the teacher says that the World War II was fought in 1940s, Ramesh does not tolerate this kind of generalisation. He stands up and says, “Sir, to be exact from 1939 to 1945.” This lean and thin spectacled pantaloon had faced many interviews including the N.D.A. It was not the Board that interviewed him but it was Ramesh who interviewed the Board. The result was obvious. Everytime he got a rejection letter.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Now read about the “Professor” who knew too much and find out if he knew enough!<br />
Answer:<br />
Attempt yourself.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
The ‘Professor’ knew too much. How did he prove himself ? Fill up the space with suitable examples from the story, using the given clues :<br />
(a) about muzzle velocity : _____<br />
(b) after a thirty mile walk : _____<br />
(c) his salute on payday : ______<br />
(d) the loud sound of a high flying invisible aeroplane : _______<br />
(e) about hand grenades : _______<br />
(f) during cook house duties :. _______<br />
Answer:<br />
The ‘Professor’ certainly knew too much. He had everything on the tips of his fingers. He borrowed training manuals and read them all at night. He troubled instructors with questions. He always tried to show that all others, including his instructors, knew much less than him.</p>
<p><strong>(a) about muzzle velocity:</strong> When a Sergeant defines muzzle velocity or the speed at which the bullet leaves the rifle, the Professor interrupts, “Two thousand, four hundred and forty feet per second”.</p>
<p><strong>(b) after a thirty mile walk:</strong> After a thirty mile walk he was not only wonderfully tireless but would display his terrible heartiness. He would say, “What about a song, chaps?”</p>
<p><strong>(c) his salute on payday:</strong> His salute on payday was a model to behold. When officers in sight he would swing his skinny arms marching like a Guardsman.</p>
<p><strong>(d) the loud sound of a high flying invisible aeroplane:</strong> The ‘Professor’ could unmistakably identify it by the harsh engine note, due to the high tip speed of the airscrew.</p>
<p><strong>(e) about hand grenades:</strong> The ‘Professor’ gave a very specific answer about the fragments of the outside of a grenade. He told, “Forty- Four”.</p>
<p><strong>(f) during cook house duties:</strong> During cook house duties he protested against the unscientific and unhygienic method of peeling potatoes resulting in sheer waste of vitamin values.</p>

<p>Question 5.<br />
<strong>Answer the following questions briefly:</strong><br />
(a) What is a ‘nickname’ ? Can you suggest another one for Private Quelch?<br />
(b) Private Quelch looked like a ‘Professor’ when the author first met him at the training depot. Why?<br />

(e) What did the Professor mean by “intelligent reading”?<br />
(f) What were the Professor’s ambitions in the army?<br />
(g) Did Private Quelch’s day to day practices take him closer towards his goal? How can you make out?<br />
(h) Describe Corporal Turnbull.<br />
(i) How did Private Quelch manage to anger the Corporal?<br />
(j) Do you think Private Quelch learnt a lesson when he was chosen for cookhouse duties?<br />
Give reasons for your answer.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) A ‘nickname’ is an informal, often humorous name given to a person. The name is connected with his real name, his personality or appearance or with something he has done. The nickname of Private Quelch was the ‘Professor’. Another nickname for him could be ‘Mr. Show Off’.</p>
<p>(b) Private Quelch looked like a ‘Professor’ when the author first met him at the training depot. He was lanky, stooping, frowning through his horn-rimmed spectacles. A five- minute-conversation would bring out his debating skills and abilities. All these traits are generally found in university professors,</p>
<p>(c) The Sergeant who was describing the mechanism of a service rifle to the soldiers was as dark and sun-dried as raisins. He was wearing North-West Frontier ribbons. The sun-dried appearance of the Sergeant suggested that he had served in British India. There, the scorching heat of the sun bake the skin and made it tanned like raisins.</p>
<p>(d) The Sergeant didn’t relish when Private Quelch interrupted him. He went on lecturing. When he had finished, he turned with his questions again and again to the Professor. But it only enhanced the Professor’s reputation and glory. He had all by heart, the parts of the rifle or its use and care. The Professor knew them all. His knowledge exposed even further as the Sergeant’s classes went on.</p>
<p>(e) The smart answers given by the Professor made the Sergeant ask if he had taken any training before. The Professor replied confidently, “No, Sergeant. It’s all a matter of intelligent reading.” The Professor meant that he had read everything thoroughly and with concentration.</p>
<p>(f) The Professor’s greatest ambition in the army was to get a commission. In pursuit of his ambition he worked hard reading the training manuals. He tried to impress the instructors and the senior officers by his knowledge, promptness and smartness. But he would go step by step. As a first step, he meant to get a stripe.</p>
<p>(g) Private Quelch’s day-to-day practices might have not won him a commission in the army but it was not the end for him. Whenever he spoke, the squad listened to him in a cowed, horrified kind of silence. Instead of being nominated for a commission, he was nominated for permanent cookhouse duties. But everybody believed that his nomination for the commission was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>(h) Corporal Turnbull was a smart youngman. But he was not a man to be fooled around or talked frivolously with. He had come from Dunkirk with all his equipment correct and accounted for. He was the hero of soldiers. They thought him so tough that they could hammer nails into him without his noticing them.</p>
<p>(i) Corporal Turnbull was explaining that the outside of a grenade was divided up into a large number of fragments. The Professor at once told that the correct number was forty four. The Corporal said nothing, but his brow tightened. He was the kind of man not to be trifled with. He didn’t like any interruption. He cut the Professor to size by sending him for permanent cookhouse duties.</p>
<p>(j) There is no indication that Private Quelch learnt any lesson when he was chosen for cookhouse duties. He didn’t stop exhibiting his knowledge. When he entered the kitchen he started finding fault with the working staff. He protested against the ‘unscientific’ and ‘unhygienic’ method of peeling potatoes. He considered it a ‘sheer waste of vitamin values’.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
At first, Private Quelch was a hero in the eyes of his fellow soldiers. Support this observation with suitable examples from the story in about 100 words.<br />
Answer:<br />
At first, Private Quelch impressed all his fellow soldiers with his profound knowledge about everything under the sun. He was nicknamed as the ‘Professor’. The lanky, stooping and frowning ‘Professor’ was almost a hero in the eyes of his fellow soldiers. He had earned a certain respect from his colleagues. He wanted to get on in life. He had a brain that had a flair for details. He was always to the point and specific. In the very first lesson in musketry, he left his mark on the fellow soldiers. He had no liking for generalisation. When it came to telling the velocity at which the bullet leaves the rifle, the Professor was there to correct to the last digit. The Sergeant in the hope of revenge turned his questions again and again to the Professor. But the Professor was prompt in answering all the questions. Similarly, the Professor irritated Corporal Turnbull by interrupting and correcting him. He was sent for permanent cookhouse duties. Later on, his fellow soldiers couldn’t stand him for exhibiting his knowledge. They fled away whenever they saw him.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Private Quelch knew ‘too much’. Give reasons to prove that he was unable to win the admiration of his superior officers or his colleagues in about 100 words.<br />
Answer:<br />
No doubt, Private Quelch or the Professor knew ‘too much’. He wds a lanky and stooping man frowning through his horn­rimmed spectacles. He was aptly nicknamed die Professor. But Private Quelch’s habit of exhibiting his knowledge irritated his fellow- soldiers as well as his superior officers. Each time when one of his colleagues made a mistake, he would publicly correct him. He was always very condescending. He tried to show how superior he was to all of them. He badgered (he instructors with questions. When a Sergeant instructor described the muzzle velocity well over 2000 feet per second, the Professor corrected him. He replied 2440 feet per second. The irritated Sergeant in the hope of revenge, turned his questions again and again to the Professor. Corporal Turnbull cut the Professor to size for interrupting him. He snubbed Private Quelch by nominating him for permanent cookhouse duties. Even his colleagues fled when the Professor was nearby to avoid his sermonising.</p>

(c) Character Sketch of Private Quelch<br />
Private Quelch was a soldier without a rank. He was a tall and stooping man. He appeared frowning through horn-rimmed spectacles. His appearance, his reading habit and his deep knowledge earned him a nickname of the Professor.</p>
<p>Private Quelch meant to get on in life. He had brains. He was sure to get a commission before long. But as on first step, he meant to get a ‘ V’-shaped stripe. Private Quelch was not only ambitious but also very diligent. Even his fellow soldiers gave him credit for that. He borrowed training manuals and read late at nights. He had a flair for details and hated vague generalisations. He was always correct to the last digit.</p>
<p>The great defeat in Private Quelch was his sense of exhibitionism. He utilised his “intelligent reading” only to badger the instructors with questions. He irritated a Sergeant by his interruption during the lesson. In the hope of revenge, he turned with his questions again and again to the Professor. Similarly, he annoyed Corporal Turnbull hying to correct him publicly. He was punished and nominated for permanent cookhouse duties. Private Quelch was too showy. He always tried to show that he was much superior to all his fellow soldiers. He <span class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT2"><span style="color: black;">was always condescending. In the end his colleagues tried to avoid him. They feared his sermonising and fled when he was nearby.</span></span></p>

Answer:<br />
<span class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT2"><span style="color: black;">Army Training Depot, Liverpool.<br />
</span></span><span class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT2"><span style="color: black;">20th July, 1948 Dear Diary,<br />
</span></span><span class="MSGENFONTSTYLENAMETEMPLATEROLENUMBERMSGENFONTSTYLENAMEBYROLETEXT2"><span style="color: black;">Corporal Turnbull was certainly not fair to me today. Perhaps he had taken his revenge. What was my fault? I don’t like vague generalisations. When it came to counting the fragments of the outside of a </span></span>grenade, he should have been very specific. ‘Large number’ was a vague explanation. I gave the answer that was correct to the last digit—44 segments. I was expecting a nomination for the commission. He shocked me when he nominated me for permanent cookhouse duties.</p>
<p>My first day at cookhouse was quite a disgusting one. There is no system there. I protested against the unscientific and unhygienic method of peeling potatoes. Quite ridiculous and disgusting! Who should tell these fools that they are only wasting vitamin values by doing so. I will have to educate that gang of louts. They think that I am showy. But what can I do? I love knowledge and love to show it. And this is my fault. I can’t help it.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>ABOUT THE STORY<br />
</strong></span>‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’ brings home the idea that self-pride and over­confidence, together with tactlessness, often prove to be harmful. It depicts an encounter between the narrator and Private Quelch, a soldier at the training depot. For his too much sermonizing Private Quelch has come to be named ‘Professor’. He had great knowledge but he was in the habit of interrupting even his seniors. He interrupted his Sergeant about muzzle velocity. Once he interrupted and corrected Corporal Turnbull about the structure of a hand grenade. The Corporal being vindicative sent him to the kitchen on a permanent duty where he continued sermonizing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>CHARACTERS<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>(i) Private Quelch<br />
</strong>Private Quelch or ‘Professor’ is a good-intentioned but tactless fellow. He is a storehouse of awesome knowledge which he continues to display. He will interrupt and correct even his seniors in public, most of whom feel irritated and humiliated. He has great ambitions regrading his career. He has passion to surpass others. He is innocent to a point of fault. His habit of interrupting others in a rude manner proves to be harmful. His dreams are shattered when he is sent to kitchen on permanent duty. Ironically, he continues sermonizing even in the kitchen.</p>

What were the Professor’s ambitions in the army ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>VALUE-BASED LONG ANSWER QUESTIONS (SOLVED)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Answer the following questions in 80-100 words each.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span></strong><br />
&#8220;Too much knowledge is also a bane’. Comment on the statement with reference to Private Quelch’s character. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Having too much knowledge is not a bane. In fact, each one of us should aim at getting as much knowledge as possible. A knowledgeable person, if he is wise also, is respected and honoured everywhere. It is the public show of knowledge which is bad. Sometimes it proves to be harmful, as in the case of Private Quelch. No one can dislike Private Quelch for his extraordinary knowledge. It is his tactless flaundering of knowledge that proves to be harmful to him. He is in the habit of correcting even his superiors in public. He angers the Sergeant for telling him the exact speed of the bullet while he was lecturing to the trainees. He infuriates Corporal Turnbull by correcting him and telling him to improve his lecture. Corporal Turnbull sends him on permanent cookhouse duties, jeopardizing his career.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span></strong><br />
Self-promotion always brings resentment from others. Keeping the above statement in mind, comment on the character of Private Quelch. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Self-promotion is now an accepted social value. Everyone, from a politician to an actor, is engaged in self-promotion. Watch any TV serial, you will come across examples of brazen self-promotion. But it is a fact that too much self­promotion often boomrangs. This is what we see in the case of Private Quelch. Private Quelch or the ‘Professor’ has awesome knowledge about his field. He is in a hurry to impress others with his knowledge to realize his aim of getting commission in the army. So he tactlessly makes a show-off of his knowledge. He loses no opportunity to correct even his seniors in public. His fellow trainees .begin to resent his attempts at self-promotion. He becomes a butt of their sarcasms and jokes. He tries to impress the Sergeant and the Corporal by interrupting and correcting them before others. Finally, his self­promotion costs him dearly. He is sent on permanent cookhouse duties. He loses a golden chance to get commission in the army.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span></strong><br />
Private Quelch’s ambition had blinded him. Analyse Corporal’s reaction to his behaviour. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
It is good to have an ambition. There cannot be any progress without having an aim in life. Ho ever, one should never be blinded by ambition. One should never be in a hurry to achieve one’s aim. When one is in a hurry, one becomes tactless and irrational, as Private Quelch becomes. He wants to get commission in the army. He has acquired knowledge which is more than sufficient. He can easily achieve his aim. Yet he jeopardizes his prospects by his tactless behaviour. He annoys Corporal Turnbull by publicly correcting him. The Corporal takes a revenge on him by sending him on permanent cookhouse duties. His reaction is natural. But we feel that it is too severe and negative. He should have given Private Quelch some other less severe punishment.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:</span></strong><br />
‘It’s all a matter of intelligent reading’, said Private Quelch. Evaluate the statement on the basis of Professor’s character. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Private Quelch made this remark when the Sergeant, impressed by his knowledge, asked him, “You had any training before ?” The remark is quite tactless and reveals Professor’s self-pride and his tendency to show off. It, no doubt, annoys his senior. Even his juniors feel that he has crossed the limits by publicly correcting the Sergeant as to what the exact speed of the bullet is. Intelligent reading is good, but the way it is used matters a lot. Private Quelch uses his knowledge for self-promotion and, that too, tactlessly. No wonder, he gets his career jeopardized by infuriating Corporal Turnbull.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 5:</span></strong><br />
Although the Professor was knowledgeable and willing to share his knowledge with his mates, they avoided crossing paths with him. Comment with reference to ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much.’ <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Knowledgeable persons are sometimes avoided by their friends and associates. It is so because no one wants to be overshadowed all the time by someone. Private Quelch or the Professor has acquired much knowledge about his field. When he begins to outdo his fellow trainees with his superior knowledge they begin to avoid him. One day at the end of a tiring, thirty mile route march he suggested with his horrible heartiness, “What about a song chaps ?” No one greeted the suggestion. Day in and day out he began to lecture to them in his droning, remorseless voice on every aspect of human knowledge. Very soon his peers were in an awe of him. He was made a butt of sarcasms and jokes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 6:</span></strong><br />
What were the negative characteristics of Private Quelch’s character ? Explain any four. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Private Quelch was a hardworking, simple-minded fellow. But he has some glaring negative personality traits. He was in the bad habit of showing off his knowledge. He would lose no opportunity to do so. Then he was quite tactless. He did not know that it was not good to interrupt one’s seniors in an effort to impress them. He was also ready to correct others in public. He was unaware that one feels embarrassed and humiliated if corrected before strangers. He was also a very condescending person. He would sometimes try to please his seniors by outshining others. All these character traits made him unpopular among both his seniors and juniors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 7:</span></strong><br />
What were the positive characteristics of Private Quelch’s character ? Explain any four. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong>(CBSE 2014)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Private Quelch was a hardworking fellow. He would spend a lot of time in reading books and manuals. He wanted to acquire as much knowledge as possible. Indeed, he was a highly knowledgeable person. He could recall the minor details of what he had read. Then he was quite helpful. Whenever he found someone doing something wrong, he extended his helping hand willingly. He seemed to be free from ill-will against anyone. He did not pay any attention to his fellow trainees’ sarcasms and jokes. He had no grudge even against Corporal Turnbull. He seemed to be happy and contented with his duties in the cookhouse.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 8:</span></strong><br />
“As a punishment Quelch was put on kitchen duties.”<br />
Imagine yourself as the author of the story “The Man Who Knew Too Much”. Write a letter to your friend explaining the reason for giving him such punishment. <span style="color: #ff00ff;"><strong> (CBSE 2012)<br />
</strong></span><strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
10 Green House<br />
Mountain Top, MA<br />
3rd March, 20&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>Dear George Hope you’re fine!<br />
Thank you for reading my story. You have protested against the unjust punishment given to Private Quelch. You will agree with me that showing off one’s knowledge to belittle others in public is not a minor offence. It can infuriate anyone. Corporal Turnbull, if you remember, is a severe, hardy person.<br />
How can he ignore anyone’s snub ? He acts as per his character traits. If he does not punish the Professor he will be acting against his own nature. So he sends him to kitchen so that he dare not cross his path again. Private Quelch, according to me, deserves punishment, and that is the message of the story : don’t cross the limits of decency even if you’re right.<br />
Hope you’ll agree with me. Or we can agree to disagree. What do you say ?<br />
Yours sincerely<br />
Alexander</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 9:</span></strong><br />
‘Each time one of us made a mistake the Professor would publicly correct him.’<br />
The ‘Professor’ was in the habit of finding faults. He would criticize anyone in public. Do you approve or disapprove his behaviour ? Should we make fun of others in public, even if they are wrong ? What would be the consequences if we do so ?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
Private Quelch, called ‘Professor’ in jest, was in the habit of finding faults, sermonizing and publicly correcting others. He was not tactful, as he berated even his seniors in public, for which he had to suffer. He was sent on an unimportant duty in the kitchen.<br />
We disapprove his behaviour. We should not berate anyone in public even if he is at fault or his knowledge is imperfect. We should particularly be careful while dealing with our superiors. Our superiors who can harm us will not tolerate any public criticism, however fair they may be.<br />
If we persist in criticising and correcting others in public, we are likely to invite trouble. The person thus criticised will feel humiliated and react in some way or the other. He may assault us physically in anger. If in power, he may harm our career in some way. So, we should be tactful and practical. We should show off our knowledge only when it is safe and desirable to do so.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 10:</span></strong><br />
You are ‘Professor’. Write a diary entry after your first day at the cookhouse, describing the events that led to this assignment, also express your thoughts and feelings about the events of the day in about 150 words.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span></strong><br />
2nd January, 20&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; , Wednesday<br />
10 p.m.</p>
<p>I am sad at what happened today. I am peeling potatoes in the cookhouse­something I had never dreamt of. I know it will be very difficult for me to get the active duties once again. Corporal Turnbull is really angry with me.</p>
<p>I don’t know what possessed me when I could not contain myself and interrupted the Corporal when he was explaining the structure of the grenade. When he asked me to give the lecture in his place, I did not realize its implications. In my zeal to prove myself I spoke on the subject well. My colleagues seemed to be overawed. They were silent and perhaps knew better than me what was in my store. The Corporal got really offended with my approach. He said nothing but sent me to the cookhouse.</p>
<p>I know it is a punishment duty. But what can I do ? Even here when I find people doing something wrong, I fail to check myself and try to correct them. People call it ‘sermonizing’. Whatever it is, it is. I cannot overlook ignorance. Of course, I shall try to be a bit more rational and tactful in future.</p>
