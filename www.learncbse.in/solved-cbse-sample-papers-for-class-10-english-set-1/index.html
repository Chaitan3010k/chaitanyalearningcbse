READING</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow :<br />
Galapagos penguin-species of penguin characterized by the presence of a narrow C &#8211; shaped band of white feathers, that extends from the eye to the chin on each side of the head and a single band of black feathers, that cuts across the large region of white feathers on the breast. Galapagos penguins, the most northerly of all penguin species, inhabit the western part of the Galapagos Islands; however, some individuals may occasionally venture to other islands in the archipelago. Compared with other penguin species, the population is small, numbering no more than a few thousand individuals.<br />
Galapagos penguins are among the smallest of all penguin species. They average about 53 cm (about 21 inches) in length and weigh from 1.7 to 2.6 kg (about 4-6 pounds), males are slightly larger than females. Juveniles, in contrast, have a grey head and black and white underside. They also possess white patches of feathers on their cheeks. The chicks are covered in a fluff of light grey downy feathers.<br />
Galapagos penguins subsist on small fish. Adults and juveniles are food for sharks and Galapagos fur seals in the water. On land, all age classes are vulnerable to the native Galapagos hawk and to predators, such as dogs, cats, rats and other birds of prey.<br />
The young are produced throughout the year and nests are built with rocks and twigs or within lava rock depressions within about 50 meters (about 165 feet) of the shoreline. Most breeding pairs are monogamous for life, and prolific pairs can produce up to three clutches of eggs per year, with females often laying two eggs per clutch. The eggs are deposited in the nest within four days of one another, and incubation is shared equally between the parents. The incubation period lasts 38 &#8211; 42 days, after which both parents provide for their chicks by alternating feeding and guarding duties on a daily basis until the chicks are 30 days old. The chicks continue to remain in the nest when they are between 30 and 60 days of age, sustained by periodic feedings by their parents.<br />
Unlike most other penguin species, Galapagos penguin chicks do not join &#8220;creches&#8221; (groups). The fledging period continues until the chicks are 60 &#8211; 65 days old and they become completely independent at age 3-6 months. Galapagos penguins can live as long as 15 &#8211; 20 years, but most succumb to predation or to food shortages caused by the periodic, but dramatic, changes in nearby ocean currents.<br />
Answer the following questions briefly :</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(a) What is the characteristic feature of a Galapagos penguin ?<br />
(b) How can a female penguin be identified ?<br />
(c) How do the penguins make their nest ?<br />
(d) How does the baby penguin’s appearance differ from that of an adult penguin?<br />
(e) Why do most of the Penguins die early ?<br />
(f) Why are the penguins not safe on land ?<br />
(g) Why are Galapagos penguin chicks different from other penguin species ?<br />
(h) How are the penguin chicks raised ?</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(a) The characteristic feature of Galapagos penguin is presence of narrow C- Shaped band of white feathers, that extends from chin on each side and single band of black feathers, that cuts across the large region of white feathers on breast.<br />
(b) Female penguins are smaller than males/or males are slightly larger than female penguin.<br />
(c) Penguins build their nest with rocks and twigs or within lava rock depressions.<br />
(d) The chicks are covered in a fluff of light grey downy feathers.<br />
(e) Penguins succumb to predation or shortage of food due to changes in ocean.<br />
(f) Penguins are killed by Galapagos hawk, dogs, cats or rats and other birds of prey.<br />
(g) Unlike other penguin species, Galapagos penguin chicks do not join creches, (groups).<br />
(h) Both penguin parents provide for their chicks by alternating feeding and guarding duties.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:<br />
I know poverty and misery and I quite appreciate by personal experience what it is to be poor, what it is to have no clothes, what it is to have no books, what it is to struggle through life, what it is to walk through the streets without an umbrella, without conveyance along miles in dusty roads. I have been through it all and I can understand the difficulties that most of you graduates have to face today. I am speaking from a long experience of 60 years. Please do not imagine that all the 60 years are milk and roses. To be able to accomplish something, I want to tell you that you have to go through such experiences.<br />
I admit, success in life is not always to the intelligent or the strong, and it is to some extent a bit of a gamble, but nonetheless, those who got their minds right and those who know their job sooner or later, will sooner perhaps than later make their way in life. But they should not be disappointed if they do not, they have to face up life and take it as they find it.<br />
What I say is this that the great things in life are not really great things in life. What I love is to enjoy the common things of life. I am happy that I am still able to sleep at night provided I have three miles walk in the evening. I am still able to enjoy a good lunch or a good dinner. I am still able to look at the blue sky and like it. I still like to walk in the open fields and like the smell of the Ragi or the Jowar.<br />
We think that happiness consists in going to pictures and seeing thrilling films and techni-colour dramas. Not at all, the great things in life are the God-given things which cost nothing.

Subject: Request for zebra crossing and traffic &#8211; lights<br />
Sir,<br />
Immediate attention need to be drawn to the traffic menace on the road in front of New Agra Public School, Ram Nagar. The road always remain congested and traffic jams are common here. The major concern arises due to the heavy rush of vehicles on the road. There are no speed breakers or zebra crossing on the road, which makes it tough for the people, especially school students, to cross the road. Thus, this road has become accident prone. I, a student of class X, New Agra Public School, on behalf of the students and school authorities, request you to make provision of marking zebra crossing on the road so that crossing on the road would not be a life threatening task for the children and other people. The authorities are also requested to put traffic lights in front of our school so that the traffic should be controlled in a managed way.<br />
Thanking you in anticipation,<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Anita/Amit<br />

Dear Diary<br />
Today I am feeling very happy. Finally, all my children are able to fly. Coaxing the youngest one was a real ordeal. He just refused to get off the ledge. We tried every method but failed. After nearly 24 hours, I could see that he was feeling really hungry, so I decided to play trick with him. I took a piece of fish in my mouth and flew close to the ledge. Maddened by hunger, he stepped forward to get the fish, lost his balance and fell outwards. Instinctively, he spread his wings and found that he could fly. It was the proud moment of my life. I shall never forget it.<br />

<p>• The Martians led by their leader launch an inter-planetary attack on the earthlings.<br />
• The Martian space probe reached Canterville Public Library.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">— They come across the book of nursery rhymes &#8220;Mother Goose&#8221;.<br />
— They misinterpreted the rhyme &#8220;Humpty Dumpty&#8221; &#8211; terrifies the Martian invaders.<br />
— They abort their plan and make good their escape.</p>

— &#8220;There are no winners or losers in a war&#8221;<br />
— The Martians seemed to be ignorant of this reality understood by human race-though little too late.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
The Martines, lead by their leader Think Tank, planned an inter-planetary attack on the Earthlings. Think Tank completely misinterpreted the book of nursery rhymes and interpreted it in a verbal manner. When Omega read the nursery rhyme ’Mistress Mary’, he was shocked to discover that on earth, metals can be grown in fields. He thought that the earthlings had discovered how to combine agriculture and mining and were now able to grow high explosives. When Omega transcribed ’Hey Diddle Diddle’, he thought that the animals on earth were also ready for a space attack. When he saw the image of Humpty-Dumpty, he thought that it was his own brain and the earthlings were planning to capture the Mass Central Control and therefore, they got ready to save their own lives instead of invading the earth. Thus, the nursery rhyme book saved the earth.<br />
Hence we see that the book of nursery rhymes saved the Earth from Martian invasion.<br />
We know peaceful coexistence is fundamental to the survival of human race. It is totally incorrect to invade another country. But Martians planned to do so. They seemed to be ignorant of the reality that there are no loosers or winners in the war- both the sides suffer.</p>

Detailed Answer:<br />
Helen came to know of Shakespeare and his plays through her reading of ‘Lamb’s ’Tales from Shakespeare’. She was much impressed with his great tragedies such as ’Macbeth’ and ’King Lear’. She could never forget the dagger scene—Lady Macbeth’s little white hand and then disturbance of her mind. In ’King Lear’ when she read the scene in which Gloster’s eyes were put out, she was filled with horror which stuck to her memory. She was surprised to read the characters of Shylock, Saten and Judas. She began to wonder to what extent man can degrade himself if he is drifted away from the path of good. She continued reading Shakespeare’s play, though she did not favour the critical analysis and commentary written about them. It made her fall in love with Shakespeare. She enjoyed his sonnets and songs.</p>

<p>Winston Churchill called Helen Keller &#8220;the greatest woman of our age.&#8221; In her childhood, she contracted an illness which the doctors described as &#8220;an acute congestion of the stomach and the brain&#8221; which could have been scarlet fever or meningitis. The illness left her deaf and blind. The world had become dark and silent for her but then, Miss Anne Sullivan entered her life. She stayed with her till her death. They had a lovely relationship. She taught her how to communicate. She used to spell words into her hands which later rolled onto sentences. Helen was quick at learning and that. she learnt everything that was taught to her. When Helen learnt that she was different from others others did not use sign language but talked with their lips, she felt vexed but gradually she learnt how to communicate effectively. She used to feel every object and made crude signs to make others understand what she wanted to say. The summer of 1887 also provided her sense of belongingness with the rest of the world. She came in contact with nature and felt how beautiful mother nature is. She felt the beauty in the fragrant words, in every blade of grass and realized that birds and flower and she herself were happy peers. She felt the love for birds when she was presented a canary as Christmas gift. She took great care of him but felt a deep sense of pain when a cat pounced upon the canary and ate him up. Her first experience in the ocean also taught her a great deal. In fact, life itself was her guide and she went on the path of life to the peak of knowledge, holding Miss Sullivan’s finger gently but boldly.</p>

<p>Anne’s feelings about the annexe constantly kept on changing. Most of the time, Anne felt that she and her family members were fortunate to have the annexe as a place to hide. She valued the kindness and generosity of her father’s non-Jewish colleagues who risked their lives to provide them with food and supplies. However, Anne often felt bad about the miserable physical and emotional conditions of the annexe; and the confinement bothered her. She missed the joy to see nature and A the sky, Anne had to live with eight people under severe conditions e.g., she had no privacy, it dealt with clashing personalities, they were living there in the fear of being discovered. Above all, she felt herself lonely since she had no companions except Peter in the annexe in whom she could confide.<br />
However, when Anne compared her deprived freedom with her Jewish friends and family members who had probably been arrested and sent to concentration camps, such as her friend Hanneli, she was extremely thankful to still be alive.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>As a thirteen-year-old girl, Anne felt that all her friends and family misunderstood her. Thus, she turned to the diary as a new friend and confident, counting on the diary to be the sympathetic with non-judgmental ear that couldn’t be found elsewhere. After the Frank family shifted to the annexe, Anne felt herself even more misunderstood. She thought her mother to be cold and callous, and also-felt that the other adults considered her a nuisance. The diary offered Anne much solace in the annexe because she was in need of a true companionship. Until she befriended Peter, Anne had no one other than her diary with whom she could openly share her fear, anger, sadness, and hope. Anne called the diary &#8220;Kitty&#8221; She considered it a close friend. She hoped that she’ld be able to confide everything to it.<br />
Anne frequently turned to her diary for comfort and support because she never wanted to burden the already overtaxed adults with her own concerns. Thus, Anne felt that paper has more patience than people.</p>
