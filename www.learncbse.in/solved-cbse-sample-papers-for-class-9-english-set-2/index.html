<p>Question 1:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions/complete the statements that follow:<br />
1. The self-governing National Red Cross Societies, including the Red Crescent (in Muslim countries) and the Red Lion and Sun (in Iran), operate on the national level through their volunteer members, although they also participate in international work. Each must be recognized by the International Committee. Today numbering 114, these societies have Junior Red Cross Societies as well. Virtually all have disaster relief programs/ and many carry on welfare programs, with community health and safety instruction, and so on. Since World War II, many of the European and Asian societies have also established refugee services.<br />
2. The League of Red Cross Societies, a coordinating world federation of these societies, was established in 1919 as the result of proposals made by Henry P. Davison (1867-1922) of the American Red Cross. The League maintains contacts between the societies; acts as a clearing house for information; assists the societies in setting up new programs and in improving or expanding old ones; coordinates international disaster operations. It functions under an executive committee and a board of governors on which every national society has representation.<br />
3. The International Committee of the Red Cross [ICRC], a private, independent group of Swiss citizens chosen by co-optation (limited to twenty-five in number), acts during war or conflict whenever intervention by a neutral body is necessary, such action constituting its special field of activity. As guardian of the Geneva Conventions and of Red Cross principles, it promotes their acceptance by governments, suggests their revision, works for further development of international humanitarian law, and recognizes new Red Cross Societies; it sends its Swiss delegates into prisoner-of-war camps, supervises repatriation, operates the Central Tracina Agency, supplies material relief, and the like.<br />
4. The International Red Cross Conference, which met for the first time in 1867, is the highest legislative body. It is composed of representatives of the National Societies, the League, the International Committee, and the governments that have signed the Geneva Conventions.

<p>Question 2:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:<br />
Modem food has become our enemy. We have become so slavish to taste and presentation that we eat food for its entertainment value, not for its nutritional benefit. Even as health awareness is increasing, the variety of junk and nutrition less food is also increasing. Each restaurant boasts of a new cuisine, which is a mixture of refined flour, oil and sugar. Pasta, noodles, white rice, white bread and maida based products like pizzas, burgers, naan and rumali roti are the main options in Italian, Chinese, Indian or Mexican cuisines. The vegetarian dishes are either overcooked or have a lot of com starch and fat. The non-vegetarian dishes are either white-sauce based or made in rich gravies.</p>
<p>People are trying to lose weight by eating less in the day, so that they can accommodate such foods in the night. They skip breakfast and lunch so that they can satisfy their taste buds in the night with a family dinner. Perfect health, however, cannot be achieved by a process of eating less and not eating . The idea is to nourish the body. You might achieve some weight loss but you will also lose out on your health.</p>
<p>Therefore, whilst embarking upon any weight loss programme, remember that health is much more than just weight loss, at the same time achieving ideal body weight in a healthy way does provide a basis for achieving perfect health.<br />
Our weight is a balancing act, but the equation is simple: If you eat more calories than you bum, you gain weight. And if you eat fewer calories than you bum, you lose weight.</p>
<p>All too often, we make weight loss much more difficult than it needs to be with extreme diets that leave us cranky and starving, unhealthy lifestyle choices that undermine our dieting efforts, and emotional eating habits that stop us before we get started. But there’s a better way! You can lose weight without feeling miserable. By making smart choices every day, you can develop new eating habits and preferences that will leave you feeling satisfied—and winning the battle of the bulge.<br />
(a) How has modem food become our enemy?<br />
(b) How do people try to lose weight?<br />
(c) What should you remember while trying to lose weight?<br />
(d) What equation is drawn to highlight our weight as a balancing act?<br />
(e) What is meant by ’nourish’? (Para 2)<br />
(f) What is meant by ’undermine’? (Para 5)<br />
(g) Find the word opposite in meaning to ’happy’. (Para 5)<br />
(h) Find the word opposite in meaning to ’neither’. (Para 1)<br />

WRITING AND GRAMMAR</p>
<p>Question 3:<br />
With lifestyle diseases so rampant today, it is time to turn our attention to clean and safe eating practices. As Usha/Ulhas of Express Today, write an article on ’Safe eating an ideal lifestyle’.<br />
Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Safe Eating an ideal life style.<br />
By Usha</p>
<p>Eating is important and essential, however excess or lack of eating is dangerous. In fact, eating is not natural instinct but skill that needs to be taught and change according to age and body mass of the individuals. Healthy eating is a way of life and its importance cannot be isolated from every day reality. At the same time, this is the repsonsibility of the schools also to instruct and provide healthy food to the students. Interventions targeted at healthy eating need to occur early in childhood and adolescence in order to prevent or reverse the adverse effects of overweight or poor eating habits. It is now up to the schools to take the matter in hand. Schools are the ones who influence most as they are nearest to the child. They have to contribute directly to the study of healthy eating. And I am sure that if students learn the habit of safe eating, they will lead an ideal lifestyle.</p>

Answer:<br />
Evelyn Glennie was a very brave girl. She learnt to open her body and mind to the sounds and vibrations. She used to feel as if music was flowing through her body skin, her cheekbones and even in her hair. She attained the state of trance in which her mind used to think only about music. Music had become her passion. So she joined an orchestra and later the Royal Academy of Music. She did not want to be deprived of the joy of music that made her happy. Shy later even gave solo performances on stage in many countries and became famous.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>The poem ’The Road Not Taken’ offers a profound perception into the process of decision making. The traveller at the crossroads of the diverging roads is symbolic of an individual at a decisive moment in his life’s journey. His decision or choice of future action, which road he should adopt spiritualism or materialism, is of utmost significance since the decision decides his destiny.The poet, Robert Frost, through this poem asserts the importance of the right decision at the right time. In life we have to make our choices; sometimes we have to make these choices without the full understanding of the state of affairs. Even then, we should arrive at decision only after carefully considering all the available options. We may regret our choice or we may be excited about our choice, but the choice at the crucial moment will determine and change the path of our life. Hence, the poem stresses the need for deep and critical analysis of the situation before we arrive at a life transforming decision.</p>
