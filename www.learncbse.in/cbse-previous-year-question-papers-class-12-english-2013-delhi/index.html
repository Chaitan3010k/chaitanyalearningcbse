The students wore eco-friendly dresses. The corridors were decorated with the posters made by the children with the help of their art teacher. Many activities were organized on this occasion. A small play was presented by the students in connection with the environment friendly measures which should be adopted by the people. There was also an exhibition of the things made by the junior section of the school, which included paper bags, jute bags, and products made up of biodegradable matter. Our Principal gave an inspiring speech on how to preserve our environment. Student speakers also presented their views on the conservation of environment. After the function was over, tree plantation drive started. The first tree was planted by the Principal followed by the faculty members and then the children.

By Deepika/Deepak (Secretary, Ahimsa Club) 2nd October was a memorable day for our school as it observed &#8216;International day for Peace and Non-violence. We all know that this day is celebrated to commemorate Mahatma Gandhi, who was the greatest messenger of peace and non-violence. Various activities were organized by the school. Students were told the importance of &#8216;Charkha Spinning&#8217; and they enjoyed doing it by themselves. At the back stage, a group of students sang Bapu&#8217;s favourite bhajan &#8216;Vaishnav jan to tinhe kahiye in a choir. There were speeches made on the way of living that Gandhiji advocated all his life and the means to achieve them which according to Bapu should be noble and high. After that the children were taken to the Samadhi of Gandhiji known as &#8216;Rajghat&#8217;. The teachers as well as children paid homage to Bapu. The eminent Gandhians delivered speeches and told that he was a great example of selfless service, self-discipline, renunciation and deep love for suffering humanity.</p>
<p>In the evening, we returned back to the school to disperse to our homes but there was a sense of content and peace in our mind and soul.</p>

Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to draw the attention of the General Manager, Delhi Transport Corporation towards the increasing cases of rash bus driving. This has created havoc in the city as it has become a routine habit of the drivers. Daily one or two cases of mishaps due to the negligence of the drivers are coming into light. It&#8217;s not an overheard thing, but I have experienced it myself as I am a regular commuter by bus from Noida to Delhi. The number of accidents have been increasing daily which results in the loss of many lives. This should be checked as drivers are indifferent towards the sufferings of the public and do not pay heed towards the traffic rules. The most common sufferers are the elders and the children. Immediate action is the need of the hour. Either the registration of their vehicle should be cancelled or their driving license, to bring such mishaps under control.<br />
I expect a favorable response.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
Priti/Prakash<br />

<p>Question 6.<br />
Your family has recently shifted from Kota in Rajasthan to Emakulam in Kerala, where your house is situated in the midst of beautiful flowering plants and fruit-yielding trees. Every minute and every second, you are experiencing the joy of being in the lap of nature. Write an article in 150-200 words on the diversity of nature that you have experienced. You are Latha/Lalitha of class XII. [10]<br />
OR<br />
Write an article in 150-200 words on the topic, &#8216;Poverty is the cause of all evils&#8217;, to be published in the Young World of &#8216;The Hindu&#8217;, Chennai.<br />
Answer:<br />
IN THE LAP OF NATURE<br />
By Latha/Lalitha Class XII<br />
One can find huge diversity in nature while living in India. I experienced it personally when we shifted to Ernakulam in Kerala from Kota, Rajasthan. It seemed as if we have shifted not places but nature. From the brown mountains to the green canopies, the change was completely welcomed by all the family members. For the first time in my whole life, I saw such greenery. The words used for Kerala as &#8216;God&#8217;s Own Country&#8217;, appeared to be true which I had only heard or read till now. Living in the lap of nature is a completely new experience. The greenery is extremely enchanting and to add to its beauty, is the location of my house amidst the beautiful flowering plants and fruit yielding trees. The fragrance of the blooming flowers fill the house and the aroma enters the soul. The view of fruit-laden trees is equally fascinating. There is no sign of pollution here. Evergreen beaches, fishing nets spread all over the sea, the richness of coconut and jackfruit, all make it a desired place to live in. The place has not lacked even in the preservation of its culture. The boat race in the backwaters is done during the festival of Onam. It is famous for its spices and &#8216;Ayurvedic Kerala Massage.&#8217; In all, I must say that I enjoy the bracing environment, relaxed life, temples, backwaters and shaded woods of Kerala.<br />

POVERTY IS THE CAUSE OF ALL EVILS<br />
By Xyz<br />
India is a country where most of the population live in villages and below poverty line. Poverty prevails not only in villages but also in big cities. The metro cities are full of slums, where majority of people are living in inhumane conditions. Their basic needs for food, shelter and clothing are not fulfilled. Millions and millions of people are the victims of malnutrition, hunger, poor health and illiteracy. Their condition is not better than stray dogs. The prices are rising at a very high rate and in the same way their condition is also deteriorating. The rich are becoming richer, and the poor are becoming poorer. Circumstances and negligence force them to adopt evil means and criminal activities like robbery, murder, kidnapping, looting and so on. Children are made to beg and women are compelled to become prostitutes. If it is not acceptable to anyone, then they commit mass suicide.</p>
<p>The society, reformatory organizations, government, and non-profit organizations should take a step forward to improvise the condition of these people. There should be a check on the fund allocated for poverty removal and also whether it is properly utilised or not.</p>

<p>(b) The poet conveys the message that the life of the children living in slum is limited to their filthy dark room only. They have no future or hope and they don&#8217;t know the outer world. This problem can be solved only when a school inspector, educationist or a governor comes here.</p>

<p>(d) Sophie&#8217;s brother Geoff was the only person in her life to whom she could confide in. He was an introvert who used to speak very little and so she thought that he would never let any of her secret out. She felt that she would be safe with him anywhere in this strange world.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Answer the following in 125-150 words : [10]<br />
How did the peddler feel after robbing the crofter? What course did he adopt and how did he react to the new situation? What does his reaction reveal?<br />
Answer:<br />
The peddler robbed thirty kronors from crofter&#8217;s house who gave him shelter for the whole night in his cottage showing him kindness and hospitality. The peddler felt very happy after that and believed that it was not safe to walk along the public highway. So, he went into the woods but lost his way and when he could not get out of it, he thought the whole world with its lands and seas, its cities and villages is nothing but a big &#8216;rattrap&#8217; and he was the victim of it. He felt that the bait in his case was the money that he had stolen from crofter&#8217;s house. It was now his turn to be caught in the world&#8217;s rattrap. Whenever we become the victim to temptations, we get trapped in this vicious circle.</p>
<p>Peddler could not help but think, and was trying to prove his act of robbery by thinking that crofter had put the money to trap him due to which, he got tempted. He was not the only one who was tempted, but almost everyone; some or the other day gets trapped.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Answer the following in about 100 words: [5]<br />
Exploitation is a universal phenomenon. The poor indigo farmers were exploited by the British landlords to which Gandhiji objected. Even after our independence we find the exploitation of unorganized labour:<br />
What values do we learn from Gandhiji&#8217;s campaign to counter the present day problems of exploitation?<br />
Answer:<br />
The conditions that prevailed during the time of Gandhiji are still existing. The weak and the poor are living in the same condition as they used to, prior to the independence, only the ways of exploitation have altered. The poor sharecroppers were exploited by the British landlords and their lands were snatched from them. Gandhiji fought for them systematically by gathering information and presenting the facts courageously and managed to get justice for the fear-stricken peasants. The striking feature of this was that he did not use any form of violence or unfair means.</p>
<p>These methods can be adopted by us also, as we must be aware of our strengths and weaknesses and then proceed accordingly as one should not fall into the trap by any means. We should never compromise at the cost of our dignity or selfrespect and thus sought out the solutions wisely.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
Answer the following in 125-150 words : [7]<br />
What is the bond that unites the two-the old Mr. Lamb and Derry, the small boy? How does the old man inspire the small boy?<br />
OR<br />
Do you think Dr. Sadao&#8217;s final decision was the best possible one in the circumstances? Why/ why not? Explain with reference to the story &#8216;The Enemy&#8217;.<br />
Answer:<br />
Derry and Mr. Lamb had the same sense of loneliness and they both lived a secluded life due to their physical inability. Derry experienced Mr. Lamb to be a peculiar person saying strange things which he was not able to understand, still he felt some kind of attraction towards him. He was differently- abled but was calm and maintained peace with people around him. He was not irritated by the children who called him &#8216;Lamey-Lamb&#8217;. Before coming in contact with Mr. Lamb, Derry felt lonely due to the behaviour of people but lamb inspired him and filled him with self-confidence and determination. He taught him to live his life to the fullest without brooding over his burnt<br />
face. He told him to move ahead in life as his brain and senses were working completely. He imbibed positive thinking in him and showed him the way to live life in spite of his inability because he could do much better than others. This was the bond that united both of them.<br />
OR<br />
Yes, Dr. Sadao&#8217;s final decision was the best possible one in the given circumstances because, he was hiding an enemy in his house and everybody was aware of it. Although he had no love for Americans and he was a true patriot still he saved him realizing his &#8216;sacred&#8217; duty to save a dying man. This brought an open defiance from his domestic staff and his wife had to do all the household work. Moreover, there was a high risk as he was sheltering an enemy. So, when he felt that the man was out of danger, he helped him to escape. He got a boat ready with food, water and extra clothing and asked the soldier to row the boat to a little island that was not too far from the coast and from there he could take a Korean fishing boat. One evening, there was no signaling and Dr. Sadao understood that the man was off safely on a Korean fishing boat and it was then that he had a sound sleep.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
Answer the following in 30-40 words: [2 × 2 = 4]<br />
What sort of hunts did the Maharaja offer to organize for the high-ranking British officer? What trait of the officer does it reveal?<br />
OR<br />
What did Jo want the wizard to do when Mommy Skunk approached him?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Maharaja offered to organize every sort of hunt for the high ranking British Officer which also included boar hunt, mouse hunt and so on, but refused to entertain the tiger hunt.<br />
The British officer himself was not interested in killing the tiger, he only wanted his photograph beside the body of the dead tiger with a gun in his hand. It reveals that the British officer was a boastor and self-publicist.<br />
OR<br />
Jo wanted the wizard to hit Mommy Skunk because she wanted Roger Skunk to smell foul like before and that&#8217;s why she took him to the wizard. There she hit him with the umbrella and Jo disliked it as according to her, the wizard was right.</p>

NO TOBACCO DAY<br />
By Sameer/shobita (Cultural Secretary)<br />
4th June 20XX was celebrated as &#8216;No Tobacco Day&#8217; by our school. An interesting and educative programme was organised to highlight the evil effects of tobacco on human body. The programme was inaugurated by the Director of Education. Students had exhibited pictures, posters and cartoons depicting the harms of smoking. A demonstration was presented to highlight the miserable state of tobacco addicts. The messages &#8216;No Smoking&#8217; and &#8216;Smoking is injurious to health&#8217; were preached quiet overtly. Then, the school doctor gave an illuminating discourse, on the harms caused by tobacco. He used slides, graphs and pictures to illuminate his talk. A short film was also screened to drive home the menace caused by tobacco smoking or chewing. The plight of the patients of cancer, caused by tobacco, made us shudder. We resolved not to smoke or chew tobacco.<br />

A DAYLIGHT ROBBERY<br />
By Xyz (TOI, Correspondent)<br />
New Delhi, 2nd March, 20XX: A daring daylight robbery occurred today in the house of Mr. William at 2.00 p.m. After lunch, the inmates were enjoying their afternoon siesta, when a group of marked young men entered the house, from the roof top. At first, they shut all the doors from inside and bolted the main gate from within. They cut off the telephone connection and then pointed their gun at the chest of Mr. William and demanded the keys of the safe, in which ornaments, cash, valuables and other important documents were kept. The head of the family was helpless and had to submit the keys. According to Mr. William, the robbers decamped with all the cash and jewellery they could. Apparently there was no loss of life. Personal rivalry is assumed to be one of the motives behind the crime.</p>

(b) The poet says, &#8216;And yet, for these children, these windows, not this map, their world&#8217;. Which world do these children belong to? Which world is inaccessible to them?<br />
Answer:<br />
(b) Through these words, the poet is conveying the message that the children dwelling in the slums have no idea of the outer world. They are living a dark and gloomy life, with no future or hope. The world map hanging in their classroom is meaningless to them. They have the view of the outer world only though the windows of the classroom. So, these windows should be much bigger so that the children may be able to come out of them.</p>
