For the same λ of incident radiation, L.H.S. is constant. So metal X with higher value of λ<sub>0</sub> will emit photoelectrons of larger K.E.<br />
(iii) Kinetic energy will not change. On reducing the distance only intensity of light changes, frequency remains same. K.E. of emitted photoelectrons depends on frequency.</p>

This is Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation. Photoelectric emission is the result of interaction of two particles—one a photon of incident radiation and other an electron of photo sensitive metal. The free electrons are bound within the metal due to restraining forces on the surface. The minimum energy required to liberate an electron from the metal surface is called work function ϕ<sub>0</sub> of the metal. Each photon interacts with one electron. The energy hv of the incident photon is used up in two parts:<br />
(a) a part of the energy of the photon is used in liberating the electron from the metal surface, which is equal to the work function ϕ<sub>0</sub> of the metal and<br />
(b) the remaining energy of the photon is used in imparting K.E. of the ejected electron.<br />
By the conservation of energy Energy of the inefficient photon = maximum K.E. of photoelectron + Work function<br />

<p>Question 62.<br />
(a) Why photoelectric effect can not be explained on the basis of wave nature of light? Give reasons.<br />
(b) Write the basic features of photon picture of electromagnetic radiation on which Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation is based. (Delhi 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) (i) The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron should be directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiations but it is not observed experimentally. Also maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons should not depend upon incident frequency according to wave theory, but it is not so.<br />
(ii) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.<br />
(iii) According to wave theory, photoelectric effect should not be instantaneous. Energy of wave cannot be transferred to a particular electron but will be distributed to all the electrons present in the illuminated portion. Hence, there has to be a time lag between incidence of radiation and emission of electrons.</p>
<p>(b) Basic features of photon picture of electromagnetic radiation :<br />
(i) Radiation behaves as if it is made of particles like photons. Each photon has energy E = hv and momentum p = h/λ.<br />
(ii) Intensity of radiation can be understood in terms of number of photons falling per second on the surface. Photon energy depends only on frequency and is independent of intensity.<br />
(iii) Photoelectric effect can be understood as the result of one to one collision between an electron and a photon.<br />
(iv) When a photon of frequency<br />
(v) is incident on a metal surface, a part of its energy is used in overcoming the work function and other part is used in imparting kinetic energy, so KE = h(v &#8211; v<sub>0</sub>).</p>

Basic features of photon picture of electromagnetic radiation :<br />
(i) Radiation behaves as if it is made of particles like photons. Each photon has energy E = hv and momentum p = h/λ.<br />

(iv) When a photon of frequency<br />
(v) is incident on a metal surface, a part of its energy is used in overcoming the work function and other part is used in imparting kinetic energy, so KE = h(v &#8211; v<sub>0</sub>).</p>

<p>Question 65.<br />
An electron microscope uses electrons accelerated by a voltage of 50 kV. Determine the de-Broglie wavelength associated with the electrons. Taking other factors, such as numerical aperture etc. to be same, how does the resolving power of an electron microscope compare with that of an optical microscope which uses yellow light? (All India 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115734" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-62.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 11 Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter Class 12 Important Questions 62" width="292" height="231" /><br />
For yellow light, wavelength X = 5.9 × 10<sup>-7</sup> m Since resolving power (R.P.) is inversely proportional to wavelength, therefore, R.P. of an electron microscope is about 10<sup>5</sup> times more than optical microscope.</p>

(ii) Important features of photoelectric effect:<br />
(a) Radiation behaves as if it is made of particles like photons. Each photon has energy E = hv and momentum p = h/λ.<br />
(b) Intensity of radiation can be understood in terms of number of photons falling per second on the surface. Photon energy<br />
depends only on frequency and is independent of intensity.<br />
(c) Photoelectric effect can be understood as the result of the one to one collision between an electron and a photon.<br />
(d) When a photon of frequency<br />
(v) is incident on a metal surface, a part of its energy is used in overcoming the work function and other part is used in imparting kinetic energy, so KE = h(v &#8211; v<sub>0</sub>)<br />

<p>Question 67.<br />
(a) Describe briefly three experimentally observed features in the phenomenon of photoelectric effect.<br />
(b) Discuss briefly how wave theory of light cannot explain these features. (All India 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Experimental features and observations of photoelectric effect :<br />
(i) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation (above the threshold frequency), the photoelectric current is directly proportional to the intensity of incident light.<br />
(ii) For a given photosensitive material and frequency of incident radiation, saturation current is found to be proportional to the intensity of incident radiation whereas the stopping potential is independent of its intensity.<br />
(iii) For a given photosensitive material, there exists a certain minimum cut-off frequency of the incident radiation, called the threshold frequency, below which no emission of photoelectrons takes place, no matter how intense the incident light is. Above the threshold frequency, the stopping potential or equivalently the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons increases linearly with the frequency of the incident radiation, but is independent of its intensity.<br />
(iv) The photoelectric emission is an instantaneous process without any apparent time lag (~10<sup>-9</sup> s or less), even when the incident radiation is made exceedingly dim.</p>
<p>(b) Wave theory cannot explain photoelectric effect:<br />
(i) According to the wave picture of light, the free electrons at the surface of the metal (over which the beam of radiation falls) absorb the radiant energy continuously. The greater the intensity of radiation, the greater are the amplitude of electric and magnetic fields. Consequently, the greater the intensity, the greater should be the energy absorbed by each electron. In this picture, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons on the surface is then expected to increase with increase in intensity. Also, no matter what the &#8216; frequency of radiation is, a sufficiently intense beam of radiation (over sufficient time) should be able to impart enough energy to the electrons, so that they exceed the minimum energy needed to escape from the metal surface. A threshold frequency, therefore, should not exist. These expectations of the wave theory directly contradict observations (a) (i), (ii) and (iii) given above.</p>
<p>(ii) In the wave picture, the absorption of energy by electrons takes place continuously over the entire wavefront of the radiation. Since a large number of electrons absorb energy, the energy absorbed per electron per unit time turns out to be small. Explicit calculations estimate that it can take hours or more for a single electron to pick up sufficient energy to overcome the work function and come out of the metal. This conclusion is again in striking contrast to observation (iv) that the photoelectric emission is instantaneous.<br />
In short, the wave picture is unable to explain the most basic features of photoelectric emission.</p>
<p>Question 68.<br />
(a) Write the important properties of photons which are used to establish Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation.<br />
(b) Use this equation to explain the concept of<br />
(i) threshold frequency and<br />
(ii) stopping potential. (All India 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Important properties of Photons :<br />
(i) In interaction of radiation with matter, radiation behaves as if it is made up of particles called photons.<br />
(ii) Each photon has energy E (= hv) and momentum p (= hv/c), and speed c, the speed of light.<br />
(iii) All photons of light of a particular frequency v, or wavelength λ, have the same energy E (= hv = hc/λ) and momentum p (= hv/c = h/λ), whatever the intensity of radiation may be. By increasing the intensity of light of given wavelength, there is only an increase in the number of photons per second crossing a given area, with each photon having the same energy. Thus, photon energy is independent of intensity of radiation.<br />
(iv) Photons are electrically neutral and are not deflected by electric and magnetic fields.<br />
(v) In a photon-particle collision (such as photon-electron collision), the total energy and total momentum are conserved. However, the number of photons may not be conserved in a collision. The photon may be absorbed or a new photon may be created.<br />
(b) Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation is<br />

This equation shows that the greater the work function ϕ<sub>0</sub>, higher the threshold frequency v<sub>0</sub> needed to emit photoelectrons.<br />
Thus, there exists a threshold frequency v<sub>0</sub> (=ϕ<sub>0</sub>/h the metal surface, below which no photoelectric emission is possible, no matter how intense the incident radiation may be or how long it falls on the surface.<br />
(ii) Stopping potential. The minimum value of negative potential v<sub>0</sub>, which should be applied to the anode in a photocell, so that the photoelectric current becomes zero, is called Stopping potential.<br />

<p>Question 69.<br />
Write three characteristic features in photoelectric effect which cannot be explained on the basis of wave theory of light, but can be explained only using Einstein&#8217;s equation. (Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) (i) The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron should be directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiations but it is not observed experimentally. Also maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons should not depend upon incident frequency according to wave theory, but it is not so.<br />
(ii) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.<br />
(iii) According to wave theory, photoelectric effect should not be instantaneous. Energy of wave cannot be transferred to a particular electron but will be distributed to all the electrons present in the illuminated portion. Hence, there has to be a time lag between incidence of radiation and emission of electrons.</p>
<p>Question 70.<br />
Sketch the graph showing variation of stopping potential with frequency of incident radiations for two photosensitive materials A and B having threshold frequencies v<sub>A</sub> &gt; v<sub>B</sub>.<br />
(i) In which case is the stopping potential more and why?<br />
(ii) Does the slope of the graph depend on the nature of the material used? Explain. (All India 2016)<br />

which is justified to be called as threshold frequency.</p>
<p>Question 72.<br />
Point out two distinct features observed experimentally in photoelectric effect which&#8217; cannot be explained on the basis of wave theory of light. State how the &#8216;photon picture&#8217; of light provides an explanation of these features. (Comptt. All India 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) (i) The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron should be directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiations but it is not observed experimentally. Also maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons should not depend upon incident frequency according to wave theory, but it is not so.<br />
(ii) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.<br />
(iii) According to wave theory, photoelectric effect should not be instantaneous. Energy of wave cannot be transferred to a particular electron but will be distributed to all the electrons present in the illuminated portion. Hence, there has to be a time lag between incidence of radiation and emission of electrons.</p>
<p>(b) Basic features of photon picture of electromagnetic radiation :<br />
(i) Radiation behaves as if it is made of particles like photons. Each photon has energy E = hv and momentum p = h/λ.<br />
(ii) Intensity of radiation can be understood in terms of number of photons falling per second on the surface. Photon energy depends only on frequency and is independent of intensity.<br />
(iii) Photoelectric effect can be understood as the result of one to one collision between an electron and a photon.<br />
(iv) When a photon of frequency<br />
(v) is incident on a metal surface, a part of its energy is used in overcoming the work function and other part is used in imparting kinetic energy, so KE = h(v &#8211; v<sub>0</sub>).</p>
<p>Question 73.<br />
(i) How does one explain the emission of electrons from a photosensitive surface with the help of Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation?<br />
(ii) The work function of the following metals is given : Na = 2.75 eV, K = 2.3 eV, Mo = 4.17 eV and Ni 5.15 eV. Which of these metals will not cause photoelectric emission for radiation of wavelength 3300 A from a laser source placed 1 m away from these metals? What happens if the laser source is brought nearer and placed 50 cm away? (Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115745" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-73.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 11 Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter Class 12 Important Questions 73" width="368" height="222" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-73.png 368w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-73-300x181.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 368px) 100vw, 368px" /><br />
Because the work function of Mo and Ni is more than the energy of the incident photons; so photoelectric emission will not take place from these two metals Mo and Ni. When the laser source is brought nearer and placed 50 cm away, the kinetic energy of photo-electrons will not change, only photoelectric current will change.</p>
<p>Question 74.<br />

(i) Which one of the two metals has higher threshold frequency?<br />

<p>Question 75.<br />
(i) State two important features of Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation.<br />
(ii) Radiation of frequency 1015 Hz is incident on two photosensitive surfaces P and Q. There is no photoemission from surface P. Photoemission occurs from surface Q but photoelectrons have zero kinetic energy. Explain these observations and find the value of work function for surface Q. (Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i)<br />
Important features of photoelectric effect:<br />
(a) Radiation behaves as if it is made of particles like photons. Each photon has energy E = hv and momentum p = h/λ.<br />
(b) Intensity of radiation can be understood in terms of number of photons falling per second on the surface. Photon energy<br />
depends only on frequency and is independent of intensity.<br />
(c) Photoelectric effect can be understood as the result of the one to one collision between an electron and a photon.<br />
(d) When a photon of frequency<br />
(v) is incident on a metal surface, a part of its energy is used in overcoming the work function and other part is used in imparting kinetic energy, so KE = h(v &#8211; v<sub>0</sub>)</p>
<p>(ii) Since no photoelectric emission takes place from P, it means frequency of incident radiation (10<sup>15</sup> Hz) is less than its threshold frequency (v<sub>0</sub>)<sub>p</sub>.<br />
Photo emission takes place from Q but kinetic energy of photoelectrons is zero. This implies that frequency of incident radiation is just equal to the threshold frequency of Q.<br />

This is Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation. Photoelectric emission is the result of interaction of two particles—one a photon of incident radiation and other an electron of photo sensitive metal. The free electrons are bound within the metal due to restraining forces on the surface. The minimum energy required to liberate an electron from the metal surface is called work function ϕ<sub>0</sub> of the metal. Each photon interacts with one electron. The energy hv of the incident photon is used up in two parts:<br />
(a) a part of the energy of the photon is used in liberating the electron from the metal surface, which is equal to the work function ϕ<sub>0</sub> of the metal and<br />
(b) the remaining energy of the photon is used in imparting K.E. of the ejected electron.<br />
By the conservation of energy Energy of the inefficient photon = maximum K.E. of photoelectron + Work function<br />

(ii) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.<br />
(iii) According to wave theory, photoelectric effect should not be instantaneous. Energy of wave cannot be transferred to a particular electron but will be distributed to all the electrons present in the illuminated portion. Hence, there has to be a time lag between incidence of radiation and emission of electrons.</p>
<p>Question 77.<br />
Explain giving reasons for the following:<br />
(a) Photoelectric current in a photocell increases with the increase in the intensity of the incident radiation.<br />
(b) The stopping potential (V<sub>0</sub>) varies linearly with the frequency (v) of the incident radiation for a given photosensitive surface with the slope remaining the same for different surfaces.<br />
(c) Maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is independent of the intensity of incident radiation. (All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The collision of a photon can cause emission of a photoelectron (above the threshold frequency). As the intensity increases, number of photons increases. Hence, the current increases.<br />

<h4>Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter Class 12 Important Questions Long Answer Type</h4>
<p>Question 84.<br />
(a) Write three observed features of photoelectric effect which cannot be explained by wave theory of light.<br />
Explain how Einstein&#8217;s photoelectric equation is used to describe these features satisfactorily.<br />
(b) Figure shows a plot of stopping potential (v<sub>0</sub>) with frequency (v) of incident radiation for two photosensitive materials M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>.<br />

Explain<br />
(i) why the slope of both the lines is same?<br />
(ii) for which material emitted electrons have greater kinetic energy for the same frequency of incident radiation? (Comptt. All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a)<br />
(i) The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron should be directly proportional to the intensity of incident radiations but it is not observed experimentally. Also maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electrons should not depend upon incident frequency according to wave theory, but it is not so.<br />
(ii) According to wave theory, threshold frequency should not exist. Light of all frequencies should emit electrons provided intensity of light is sufficient for electrons to eject.<br />
(iii) According to wave theory, photoelectric effect should not be instantaneous. Energy of wave cannot be transferred to a particular electron but will be distributed to all the electrons present in the illuminated portion. Hence, there has to be a time lag between incidence of radiation and emission of electrons.</p>
<p>(b)<br />
(i) The slope (V<sub>0</sub>/v) of both the lines is the same and represents the universal constant known as &#8216;Planck&#8217;s constant&#8217; (h) = 6.62 × 10<sup>-34</sup>JS<br />
(ii) For the same frequency of incident radiations, M<sub>1</sub> will have greater kinetic energy, because the value of V<sub>0</sub> is greater for M<sub>1</sub> material. It can be easily seen by drawing a vertical line (frequency being the same) and intersecting M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub> at different points (V<sub>0</sub> for M<sub>1</sub> is higher)</p>
<p>Question 85.<br />
(a) Describe briefly how wave nature of moving electrons was established experimentally.<br />
(b) Estimate the ratio of de-Broglie wavelength associated with deuterons and a-particles when they are accelerated from rest through the same accelerating potential V. (Comptt. All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Davisson and Germer experiment for wave nature of moving electrons : The experimental arrangement used by Davisson and Germer is schematically shown in the fig. It consists of an electron gun which comprises of . a tungsten filament F, coated with barium oxide and heated by a low voltage power supply (L.T. or battery). Electrons emitted by the filament are accelerated to a desired velocity by applying suitable potential/voltage from a high voltage power supply (H.T. or battery). They are made to pass through a cylinder with fine holes along its axis, producing a fine collimated beam.</p>
<p>The beam is made to fall on the surface of a nickel crystal. The electrons are scattered in all directions by the atoms of the crystal. The intensity of the electron beam, scattered in a given direction, is measured by the electron detector (collector)/ The detector can be moved on a circular scale and is connected to a sensitive galvanometer, which records the current. The deflection of the galvanometer is proportional to the intensity of the electron beam entering the collector. The apparatus is enclosed in an evacuated chamber. By moving the detector on the circular scale at different positions, the intensity of the scattered electron beam is measured for different values of angle of scattering 0 which is the angle between the incident and the scattered electron beams. The variation of the intensity (I) of the scattered electrons with the angle of scattering θ is obtained for different accelerating voltages.<br />

The experiment was performed by varying the accelarating voltage from 44 V to 68 V. It was noticed that a strong peak appeared in the intensity (I) of the scattered electron for an accelarating voltage of 54V at a scattering angle θ = 50°.</p>
<p>The appearance of the peak in a particular direction is due to the constructive interference of electrons scattered from different layers of the regularly spaced atoms of the crystals. From the electron diffraction measurements, the wavelength of matter waves was found to be 0.165 nm.</p>
<p>The de Broglie wavelength λ. associated with electrons, is given by<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-115758" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-86.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 11 Dual Nature of Radiation and Matter Class 12 Important Questions 86" width="342" height="118" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-86.png 342w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-11-Dual-Nature-of-Radiation-and-Matter-Class-12-Important-Questions-86-300x104.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /><br />
Thus, there is an excellent agreement between the theoretical value and the experimentally obtained value of de Broglie wavelength. Davisson-Germer experiment thus strikingly confirms the wave nature of electrons and the de Broglie relation.<br />
