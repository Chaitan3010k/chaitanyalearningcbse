<strong>Question.1. Read the following passage:</strong><br />
<strong> It&#8217;s Beginning to Bite</strong><br />
<strong> In these trying times, when buying ordinary food stuff can bum a hole in your pockets, comes the news that can actually help us save some hard cash when we go out to shop the next time. According to a Stanford University&#8217; study, the first of its kind in the world, there is no evidence to suggest that there are more nutritional benefits from expensive organic food than those grown by conventional methods. The researchers add that there is no difference in protein and fat content between organic and conventional milk and the vitamin count is similar in both types. The only benefit is that organic foods are not contaminated with pesticides but then before you chew on that plate of organic okra with roti made from organic wheat, they are not 100% pesticide free either. In India, organic food has been growing at 20-22% and the export market is valued at Rs 1,000 crore. Obviously, the study is not good news for that sector and for people who are big on organic food.</strong><br />
<strong> In India, eating organic food is more of a style statement than due to health worries because the stuff is expensive. But people who can, do indulge in not only organic vegetables but even organic eggs laid by &#8216;happy&#8217; hens&#8217;, who are allowed to roam around freely whereas &#8216;unhappy hens&#8217; are kept in coops. Then there are companies that have installed music channels in their cowsheds and the milk from those sheds is sold at a marked up price since it has more nutritional value because the animals are happy thanks to lilting 24 x 7 music. We don&#8217;t know yet any farmer using music to improve his crop quality, but then you never know: plants are known to respond to music.</strong><br />
<strong> Why such pickiness about food? These days, the huge number of TV shows and articles that we see and read on food provide bread and butter for the specialist. But instead of decoding food, its sources and what has gone into growing it, isn&#8217;t it much better to enjoy what7s on the plate? (Adapted from The Hindustan Times)</strong></p>

<strong> (a) Buying ordinary food stuff can&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-in these trying times. ,</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Organic and conventional milk has the&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-and&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-content and the vitamin count is also similar in both.</strong><br />
<strong> (c) According to a Stanford University study, organic food in relation to conventional food is &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-.</strong><br />
<strong> (d) One benefit of organic food is that &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-.</strong><br />

<p><strong>Question.2. Read the passage given below:</strong><br />
<strong> The Perfect Dog</strong><br />
<strong> 1. In the summer of 1967, when I was 10 years old, my father caved into my persistent pleas and took me to get my own dog. Together we drove in the family station wagon far into the Michigan countryside to a farm run by a rough-hewn woman and her ancient mother. The farm produced just one commodity — dogs. Dogs of every imaginable size and shape and age and temperament. They had only two things in common: each was a mongrel of unknown and distinct ancestry and each was free to a good home.</strong><br />
<strong> 2. I quickly decided the older dogs were somebody else&#8217;s charity case. I immediately raced to the puppy cage. &#8220;You want to pick one that&#8217;s not timid,&#8221; my father coached. &#8220;Try rattling the cage and see which ones aren&#8217;t afraid.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong> 3. I grabbed the chain-link gate and yanked on it with a loud clang. The dozen or so puppies reeled backward, collapsing on top of one another in a squiggling heap of fur. Just one remained. He was gold with a white blaze on his chest, and he charged at the gate, yapping fearlessly. He jumped up and excitedly licked my fingers through the fencing. It was love at first sight.</strong><br />
<strong> 4. I brought him home in a cardboard box and named him Shaun. He was one of those dogs that gives dogs a good name. He effortlessly mastered every command I taught him and was naturally well behaved. I could drop a crust on the floor and he would not touch it until I gave the okay.</strong><br />
<strong> 5. Relatives would visit for the weekend and returned home determined to buy a dog of their own, so impressed were they with Shaun—or &#8220;Saint Shaun,&#8221; as I came to call him. Bom with the curse of an uncertain lineage, he was one of the tens of thousands of unwanted dogs in America. Yet by some stroke of almost providential good fortune, he became wanted. He came into my life and I into his—and in the process, he gave me the childhood every kid deserves.</strong><br />
<strong> 6. The love affair lasted fourteen years and by the time he died I was no longer the little boy who had brought him along on that summer day. I was a man, out of college and working across the state in my first real job. Saint Shaun had stayed behind when I moved on. It was where he belonged. My parents, by then retired, called to break the news to me. My mother would later tell me, &#8220;In fifty years of marriage, I&#8217;ve only seen your father cry twice. The first time was when we lost Mary Ann&#8221; — my sister, who was stillborn. &#8220;The second time was the day Shaun died.&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong> 7. Saint Shaun of my childhood. He was a perfect dog. At least that&#8217;s how I will always remember him. It was Shaun who set the standard by which I would judge all other dogs to come. &#8216; (Marley and Me by John Grogan)</strong></p>

<strong> Answer.</strong> 25, Patel Nagar New Delhi 6lh October 20xx The Editor The Times of India New Delhi<br />
Subject: City scenario after incessant rains Sir<br />
I am writing this letter to you to bring to notice how the life of the common man in our city was completely disrupted by the recent rains.<br />
Our city was inundated (flooded) by the recent rains causing extensive water logging at several areas and throwing normal life out of gear. Traffic signals also failed and this further aggravated the situation leading to major traffic snarls and ugly jams. Low-lying areas had rainwater seeping into the homes of people. Most of the city&#8217;s roads were inundated with the canal water flooding on to roads and residential areas. It is high time the concerned<br />
authorities take up immediate measures for improving the situation. This should include repair and expansion of man-made sewer systems, improving the drainage channels and regular inspection of drains designed to control water run off and clean them regularly. By taking these necessary steps the municipal authorities can definitely contribute to ensuring that life of the common man is not thrown completely off gear during heavy rains. I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper to bring to the attention of the concerned authorities the prevalent scenario.<br />
Thank you Rohit<br />

Importance of Goal Setting<br />
Setting goals is the fundamental component of long-term success. The main problem with today&#8217;s youth is that they have no aims and goals set in their minds. They have a very casual attitude towards their future. Goal-setting enables the youth to develop a sense of purpose in their lives. Goals help us to focus our minds and keep us motivated.<br />
Setting goals helps students in particular to improve their academic performance. It increases their motivation to achieve and leads to a sense of pride and satisfaction. It also helps boost the self-confidence of a person. The youth of today must realize that goals give direction and purpose to one&#8217;s life. One must set clear and reasonable goals, so that one knows exactly what is required to achieve them.<br />
One must remember getting what we want doesn&#8217;t come easy. We have to work hard to achieve the results we want. This requires dedication, perseverance and most importantly the task of goal-setting.</p>

<strong> Complete the story in 150-200 words.</strong><br />
<strong> There was a poor boy who made a living with selling various objects door to door, to pay for his school. He was very hungry and felt he couldn&#8217;t walk even a few steps. He decided to ask for food at a house. He knocked the door and was stunned to see a beautiful young girl at the door step. With so much hesitation, in spite of his hunger, he asked the girl to offer a glass of water&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> It was the first time that Pooja was alone at home. Her parents would never leave her alone even for a few hours. But this had been an emergency. Her grandfather had suddenly taken ill and because of her school, Pooja couldn&#8217;t leave with them. Pooja&#8217;s mother had been very worried while leaving as she had never left her alone, but Pooja assured her that she would be fine and anyway it was just for the night, as in the morning her aunt would reach from Pune. Pooja spent the afternoon and evening playing on the computer and then finishing her home work. But with nightfall all her courage seemed to be disappearing. She thought first she would sleep with the light on but when she couldn&#8217;t get sleep with the lights shining on her face, she switched it off. Pooja started getting frightened. While tossing and turning on the bed she looked towards the window and her mind started conjuring up all sorts of shapes in the darkness. She told herself it was just a tree outside and nothing else but yet she was scared. Suddenly, she heard a noise in the hall. Pooja was alarmed. She thought of going and seeing from where the noise came from but she couldn&#8217;t get up from the bed. Finally she mustered up enough courage to go and investigate. She went into the hall and heard the noise once again. She quickly switched on the light and to her amusement and dismay, it was only her pet dog &#8216;Simba&#8217; playing in the hall.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
There was a poor boy who made a living with selling various objects door to door, to pay for his school. He was very hungry and felt he couldn&#8217;t walk even a few steps. He decided to ask for food at a house. He knocked the door and was stunned to see a beautiful young girl at the door step. With so much hesitation, in spite of his hunger, he asked the girl to offer a glass of water.<br />
The young girl understood his hunger through his eyes and offered him milk in a huge glass. With astonished look he drank the milk very slowly. And asked how much he owed her for the milk? The girl replied T don&#8217;t accept anything for kindness.&#8217; With big smile on his face, the boy thanked the girl from the bottom of his heart and left the place.<br />
Years passed by. The young girl fell ill and was diagnosed with the rarest kind of nervous condition, which was a complicated condition to treat. While many experienced doctors were baffled at her condition, she was taken to a big hospital to study about her condition. Dr. Kumar, a renowned specialist was called in by the hospital to examine her. He gave a visit to the hospital where she was admitted to learn about the rare condition. As he entered her room, Dr. Kumar immediately identified who that woman was!<br />
With all his efforts and knowledge, Dr. Kumar battled with the disease for weeks and months. At last, he won over the disease and the woman was completely cured. Everyone praised the doctor, while the woman was quite afraid about the hospital bill as she could not afford to pay.<br />
Dr. Kumar asked the hospital to send the bill to him so that he could add his charges. After receiving the hospital bill, he wrote a note on it and sent it to her. With lots of fear, she opened the bill and had no idea how much she was charged.<br />
Her eyes filled with tears and happiness once she opened the bill. She found the bill cancelled and that was not the reason for her happiness.<br />
She saw the note written by Dr. Kumar—&#8221;Bill Paid years ago with a glass of milk!&#8221;</p>

<strong> (d) How did the Albatross save the mariners from the land of ice and snow?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why did Mr. Mullick turn down Patol Babu&#8217;s request for a rehearsal?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) John&#8217;s wife got angry with him because she suspected him of infidelity, of cheating on<br />
her. So she decided to go back to her grandmother&#8217;s house and informed John in writing that her lawyer would communicate with him later.<br />
(b) Just as the snake begins to make his way back into his hole, the poet is gripped with a strange sense of horror and so conceding to the voice of his education his instinctive reaction is to pick up a log and clumsily hurl it at the snake.<br />
(c) There was a major upheavel in the sky indicating that something undesirable was<br />
going to happen. Calpumia dreamt of Caesar&#8217;s statue and saw blood gushing out of it like a fountain. A lioness gave birth to her cubs on the street and graves opened up exposing the dead. /<br />
(d) After the albatross arrived on their ship the big icebergs surrounding the mariner&#8217;s ship cracked and split enabling the helmsman to steer them out of the ice. Then a favourable southwind began to blow and the weather improved considerably. The mariners welcomed the albatross as a good Christian soul who had come to their rescue.<br />
(e) Patol Babu suggested that he should rehearse his scene. But Mr. Mullick turned down his request for the rehearsal, showing impatience at the suggestion. This was because Mr. Mullick wanted to quickly shoot the scene in the sunlight as he could see a large patch of cloud approaching the sun, which was making him impatient.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong> To correct a wrong, one should not commit another wrong as two wrongs never make one right.<br />
Good Morning Everyone, I, , have come before you all to speak on the topic, ‘The Ends do not Justify the Means&#8217;.<br />
The concept of ‘ends justifying the means’ usually involves doing something wrong to achieve a positive end and justifying the wrong-doing by pointing to a good outcome. Means can only be justified when they are morally, ethically and socially upright. For the end to always justify the means, implies that it does not matter who gets hurt in the process. For example, if you cheat to win something, does the end (winning) justify the means (cheating). This concept is a double-edged weapon which must be dealt with in the most civilised way.<br />
I would like to conclude by saying the methods which violate our sense of righteousness and morals, cannot validate the goal, no matter how worthy it is. After all, our values are what make us human.<br />
Thank you<br />
Virtual world or cyberspace is an environment using computer technology to create a simulated, three-dimensional world that a user can manipulate and explore while feeling as if he were in that world. In a virtual reality environment, the user experiences the feeling of being inside it and being a part of that world. He is also able to interact with his environment in meaningful ways.<br />
However, some psychologists are concerned that virtual reality games could psychologically affect a player. They suggest that these games place a player in violent situations, particularly as the perpetuator of violence and could result in the user becoming desensitized. Some psychologists also believe that these games can lead to cyber addiction. There have been several news stories of gamers neglecting their real lives for their online, in-gcme presence.<br />
Studies indicate that people can have real physical and emotional reactions to stimuli within a virtual game. Thus, it is quite possible that a victim of a virtual attack could feel real emotional trauma.</p>

<strong> Answer the following questions in 100-120 words each:</strong><br />
<strong> Question.11A.How did the air raids disrupt the Dutch public life?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Attempt a character sketch of Anne Frank.</strong><br />
<strong> Or, Attempt a character sketch of Otto Frank, Anne&#8217;s father.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> From Anne&#8217;s account we get a picture of the unexpected wretchedness unleashed on the Dutch people due to the air raids. The common happenings during that time were trembling houses, scared women, intense epidemics and people persistently stalked by hunger. Doctors were unable to visit their patients and there was unrestrained theft of automobiles. Thefts and burglaries became quite common. Little children smashed the windows of people&#8217;s houses and stole whatever they could lay their hands on. People could not even think of leaving their houses for five minutes for fear of finding their belongings missing in their absence. The electric clocks on the street comers were destroyed and public phones were stripped. The morale of the Dutch people was low, everyone was starving, men were shipped off to Germany and children were either sick or undernourished. Prices of commodities were expensive even in the black market.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Anne&#8217;s diary entries tell us much about her character. From the very onset we can tell that Anne is confident, creative and thoughtful. She is also a very detailed observer as is evident by her lists of birthday presents and her meticulous description of her friends. Anne also seems rather disciplined, as she often writes lengthy diary entries. Her diligence in writing enables her to release strong feelings instead of blurting them out aloud and hurting her family and friends. When Anne remarks that paper is more patient than people, she emphasizes the difficulty she has in expressing herself openly in front of others. It seems she is afraid to confide in people fearing she will hurt her loved ones. This shows that although Anne is critical of the fault of others she is sensitive to their feelings.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Otto Frank, Anne&#8217;s father, is the manager of a food company. He shares a close bond with Anne. His birthday present to her, the diary, is her favourite. Otto Frank is a caring, resourceful and wise man. When the Van Daan family arrives to stay in the Secret Annex with them, Otto Frank serves as the peacemaker of the group &#8220;pouring oil on troubled waters&#8221;. He keeps Anne, Margot and Peter engaged in studying, reading and making family trees. He is generous, kind and level-headed unlike the other adults in the Secret Annex who are harsh and stingy. Anne continually tries to impress her father, live up to his expectations and obey his wishes. Otto Frank has a strong character and is clearly the head of the Frank household.</p>

<strong> Question. 11B. Describe the progress made by Helen Keller during the two years she spent at Wright Humason School for the Deaf in New York City.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Attempt a character sketch of Mr. Gilman as a teacher.</strong><br />
<strong> Or, It was her determination that helped Helen Keller get admission to Radcliffe College. Comment.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Helen joined the Wright-Humason School for the deaf for learning and improving her vocal education. Her progress in lipreading and speech was much below her own expectations and that of the expectation of her teachers. At the Wright-Humason School, Helen learned about the sign language and lip reading and also braille to a certain extent. During her two years there Helen also studied Arithmetic, Physical Geography, French and German. It was under Miss Reamy, her German teacher&#8217;s guidance that she made more progress in German than in any of the other subjects. She found French much more difficult as her teacher Madame Olivier, did not know the manual alphabet and gave her oral instructions. Helen pursued Physical Geography with unflagging interest. It was a joy for her to learn the secrets of nature. The two years that Helen spent at New York were happy ones, and she looked back at them with genuine happiness.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Mr. Gilman was the principal of the Cambridge School of Young Ladies. Helen had entered this school full of hope and determination to succeed. Mr. Gilman was a kind and able teacher. He was always ready to help Helen as a teacher, mentor and interpreter. Though he was a busy man he would spend time with Helen. Being a kindhearted person, he was always concerned about Helen and her education. He was also most sympathetic towards Helen and showed a lot of patience with her. He read out the whole question paper to Helen most patiently. Being generous, he even let Milred, Helen&#8217;s sister, study at Cambridge with her. But due to a difference in opinion on Helen&#8217;s preparing period for college and a misunderstanding with Miss Sullivan, Helen&#8217;s mother was forced to withdraw both her daughters from Cambridge School.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
The path to get admission in Radcliffe College was marked with unimaginable difficulties. But it was the desire Helen harboured and her determination to be successful, despite the odds that helped her to overcome all the obstacles. She faced unexpected difficulties, from not having books embossed in time to begin her classes, lack of apparatus for some of her studies, to the problems related to special instructions in the classroom. Many a time even Miss Sullivan fell short of helping her with all the resources required for her preparation. At times this made Helen lose her courage but she did not lose her determination and each time moved on ahead with renewed confidence. Her faith and spirit combined with her determination helped Helen to get admission to Radcliffe College.</p>

<strong>Answer.</strong> Soaring Cut-offs Frustrates Students<br />
By: Anita<br />
Each year witnesses soaring cut-offs for university admissions. This trend has a major impact on many deserving students who are left without a seat in the colleges thus causing frustration to them.<br />
Many deserving candidates despite scoring well in their exams lose out in this race as there are very limited seats available in colleges and the number of applicants is far more. This has an adverse affect on them and at times even forces a few of them to resort to taking the extreme wrong decision. This is a serious matter and considering the plight of such students the Government should initiate steps to provide enough avenues for youngsters. The Government can start evening shifts in colleges to make more seats available for admission to different courses. Vocational courses should be given priority in the evening shifts as they are more popular with students because they provide them with employment opportunities. The Government should also take steps to set up more universities and colleges that impart quality education.<br />
If our Government gives immediate attention to this matter life of many students will take on a new direction and new avenues will open-up for them.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong> Rise in Crime in Public Transport<br />
By: Anita<br />
With the increase in the number of passengers using public transport, incidents of picking pockets and petty thefts have also seen an unprecedented rise.<br />
A number of passengers have complained of losing their wallets and mobile phones while using the crowded public transport buses and metro services. Petty crimes like pickpocketing, theft of valuables from luggage on trains and buses have been reported.<br />
Travellers who are not in groups become easy victims of pick pockets, and purse snatchers who work in crowded public transports. The concerned authorities need to exercise caution and both the police and citizens need to take up strict measures to curb this menace. Cameras should be installed in public transport and plain clothed police personnel should travel on randomly chosen hus Mid metro routes. Passengers on their part must be extra vigilant when they are travelling by public transport.<br />
Looking at the need for security in public transport we need to look at the ends to end crime against our citizens whose life line is the public transport system.</p>

<strong> (c) (i) on (ii) up (iii) in (iv) of</strong><br />

<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) About five percent of all workers in India are child workers.<br />
