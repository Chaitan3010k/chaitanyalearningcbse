Here we have given CBSE Class 10 English Workbook Solutions Unit 2 Tenses.</p>
<h2>CBSE Class 10 English Workbook Solutions Unit 2 Tenses</h2>
<p><strong>A. The concept of tense and time :</strong><br />
See the Workbook on Page 11<br />
Let us begin by studying the relationship between the different verb forms and the time they denote.</p>
<p>A. 1.<br />
Work individually<br />
Indicate the tense and time of each of the highlighted verbs in the table below. The first has been done as an example.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-101320" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/English-Workbook-Class-10-Solutions-Unit-2-Tenses-1.png" alt="English Workbook Class 10 Solutions Unit 2 Tenses 1" width="598" height="438" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/English-Workbook-Class-10-Solutions-Unit-2-Tenses-1.png 598w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/English-Workbook-Class-10-Solutions-Unit-2-Tenses-1-300x220.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px" /></p>
<p>A.2.<br />
Now compare your answers with those of your partner and discuss the following questions and write your observations in the given space.</p>
<p>(a) Is the time referred to in the sentences always the same as the tense of the verb ? What conclusion can you draw from your observation ? Write your observation below.<br />
— The time referred to in the sentences is not always the same as the tense of the verb. It is because some verbs or tenses act differently. For instance, simple present tense also acts to show future time.</p>
<p>(b) How did you find out the tense of the verbs in the sentences above ? Are there any indicators or markers that reveal the tense of the verb ? Write your observation below.<br />
— I found the tense of the verbs from its usage. The various verb forms are the indicators and markers that reveal the tense of the verb.</p>
<p>(c) Did you find any verb form that can be called ‘future form’ ? (You will learn more about the different ways of talking about future later in this unit.)<br />
— Yes, in sentence 1 ‘are planning’ is of present continuous, but it refers to future time.</p>
<p>(d) Why do you think verb forms are often labelled as ‘simple’ or ‘indefinite’, ‘progressive’ or ‘continuous’, ‘perfect’ and ‘perfect continuous’ ?<br />
— Verb forms are often labelled as ‘simple’ or ‘indefinite’, ‘progressive’, or ‘continuous’, &#8216;perfect’ and ‘perfect continuous’ because of the action or time referred to by them.</p>
<p><strong>B. Present Progressive</strong><br />
<strong>(Progressive = continuous)</strong></p>
<p>B. 1.<br />
Form<br />
See the Workbook on Page 13</p>

<p>B. 2.<br />
Verbs that are normally NOT used in the progressive form.</p>
<p>(i) Which sentence in each of the following pairs is acceptable and why ?<br />
1. (a) I am respecting you.<br />
(b) I respect you.</p>
<p>2. (a) My son loves to draw and paint.<br />
(b) My son is loving to draw and paint.</p>
<p>3. (a) We are having two cars.<br />
(b) We have two cars.</p>
<p>4. (a) I am thinking you are new to this place.<br />
(b) I think you are new to this place.</p>
<p>5. (a) The cake smells good.<br />
(b) The cake is smelling good.</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p>1. (a) not acceptable, as ‘respecting’, a verb of emotion, can’t be used in Continuous Tense.<br />
(b) is correct</p>
<p>2. (a) is correct<br />
(b) The verb ‘love’, is again of emotion and can’t be used in Continuous Tense.</p>
<p>3. (a) The verb ‘have’ is of possession ; it can’t come in Continuous Tense. So it is incorrect.<br />
(b) is correct</p>
<p>4. (a) The verb ‘thinking’ is not acceptable as it, being the verb of emotion, can’t be used in Continuous Tense.<br />
(b) is correct</p>
<p>5. (a) ‘The cake is smelling good’ is not acceptable as verb ‘smell’ being of emotion/ sensation can’t be used in Continuous Tense.<br />
<strong>Note :</strong> The verbs of emotion/sensation can’t be used in Continuous Tense. Hence, if these are used in this Tense, these are not acceptable.</p>
<p>See the Workbook on Page 15</p>
<p>(ii) Can you explain the difference between ?</p>
<p>1. (a) I just can’t imagine how you got into such a mess.<br />
(b) You’re imagining things ; nothing will happen.</p>
<p>2. (a) The coffee tastes bitter.<br />
(b) Mother is tasting coffee to check if it is too bitter.</p>
<p>3. (a) My teacher admires my art work.<br />
(b) She is admiring the latest painting I have made.</p>
<p>4. (a) The doctor is feeling the patient’s pulse.<br />
(b) The patient is feeling better.<br />
Answers:<br />
1. (b) imagining refers to a mental state. So it can’t come in present progressive tense.</p>
<p>2. (a) There is universal truth about coffee taste. It is all right. But in 2 (b) ‘tasting’ is in progressive tense. It can’t come in this tense.</p>
<p>3. (a) This sentence is all right as ‘admires’ here is related to sense appreciation.<br />
(b) The sentence is not acceptable as ‘admiring’ here should not be in progressive. ‘Admire’, the verb of emotion, is not used in continuous tenses.</p>
<p>4. (a) It is all right as the doctor is, at present, (time of speaking) feeling the patient’s pulse.<br />
(b) The patient is feeling better as it is not actually ‘feeling’ but feeling shows the general state of health.</p>

Study the following picture carefully and then write a paragraph to describe what is happening.<br />
See the Workbook on Page 17<br />
Answer:<br />
I find it interesting to describe the picture given above. It is the scene of the railway platform. The train has arrived some moments before at the platform. Some passengers are loading their luggage or belongings. Coolies are seen carrying goods to and fro on the platform. There are stalls selling various things needed by the passengers. Many passengers are walking to and fro to find the platform they are to go to. Some passengers are sipping tea while others are reading newspapers. Some are before the ‘Enquiry’ seeking information about the train they are to travel in. I hear the noise and hustle and bustle of a typical railway station platform. Some rehriwalas are serving purees and vegetables. The train which is about to leave the station seems to be starting to go. On the other platform passengers are waiting for their train to come. The railway platform is giving out a typical presentation of real India.</p>

Here is a letter Nikita wrote to her friend Susie who lives in Milan, Italy. What verb forms has she used in this letter ? Has she used a mix of verb forms ? Is there anv particular form that has been used more frequently ?<br />
See the Workbook on Page 18<br />
Answer:<br />
In this letter the verb forms mostly used are of Present Indefinite and Present Continuous Tenses. Actually, these forms are a mix of various Tenses. Along with these Tenses, Present Perfect Tense has also been used. Students themselves shall see that usage of various Tenses depends greatly on the subject. This can be seen after reading the text of the letter.</p>

<p>Milan<br />
25th October, 20 &#8211; &#8211;<br />
Dear Nikita</p>
<p>It was a great pleasure to go through your loving letter. I find it interesting that you have to do a lot of work at your end. Here I am also leading a very busy schedule of time. I am trying to reply to all your queries.</p>
<p>I am doing fine. I haven’t been able to spare more time to the writing of the novel. Regarding Bharatnatyam I am learning it and find it is simply awesome. Here in Milan the Indian Dance School is providing this facility to a lot of Indian and Italian students. Mr. Subramaniam Swamy imparts training and teaches various norms. I am learning Bharatnatyam as I have a passion to learn it.</p>
<p>I am still contemplating to visit you this winter. The winter is welcome at your end. However, it is not that much intense as it is here in Milan. I think we should come next month. We plan to stay for a short period after we come. We would like to visit New Delhi, Jaipur, Agra, Udaipur, Gwalior etc. It shall be a great pleasure to stay with you. I shall surely write to you about our visiting dates,as and when these are finalised.</p>
<p>My mom is getting better. She is receiving physiotherapy regularly and is improving day by day.</p>
<p>I shall write again as I have to go to attend my Bharatnatyam class.</p>
<p>Yours<br />
Susie</p>

<p>(b) What conclusion can you draw from these sentences about the use of present perfect and simple past forms of verbs ?<br />
Answer.<br />
The conclusion I draw from these sentences is that many of these show completion<br />
of an action in the past. Some show that the action is still not complete and is to be completed next. Actually present perfect tense shows that the action is complete at the time of speaking. An action denoted by past means that the action went on for some time but is not shown to have been completed.</p>

What did your village/town/city look like five to ten years ago and how has it changed since then ? Write a short paragraph describing the changes in its size, population, traffic, buildings, lifestyle etc. What verb forms would you mainly use to describe the changes ?<br />
(Hint: Simple Past and Present Perfect forms.)<br />
Answer.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>How has our city changed ?</strong></p>
<p>Our city has greatly changed now. Ten years ago it had a population of eight lakhs. Now it has around fiftee to twenty. There used to be a few thousand cars then. Now every street or road has as many cars as are human beings. There were no new colonies. Now it has several sectors and new multiplexes. Almost everywhere there is a continuous construction activity. Malls, air conditioned showrooms, etc, were just absent then. Now there is an enormity of them. The traffic has increased manifold as has the city’s size. It has swallowed the agricultural land that it once had around it. Almost everywhere one can see a variety of traffic like cars, buses, trucks, tractors, auto-rickshaws and rickshaws. Now the crowd and traffic jams add to the chaos on city roads. This way there is always a great hustle and bustle almost everywhere with enormous growth of the city’s population. No doubt, people’s standard of living has increased with a healthy lifestyle. They are now awakened towards the healthcare trends through yoga, jogging, walking etc.</p>
