<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>6. What are the reasons being used by Nehru for keeping India secular? Do you think these reasons were only ethical and sentimental? Or were there some prudential reasons as well?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> Reasons for keeping India secular:<br />
1. All the Muslims did not leave India during participation, some muslims stayed in India as a minority and Jawaharlal Nehru wanted to deal with them in a very civilised and dignified manner.<br />
2. He advocated security and democratic rights of Muslims as a citizen of India.<br />
No, these reasons were not only ethical and sentimental, but there were some prudential reasons also as:<br />
1. India’s secular nature cherished its long term goals and principles<br />
like socialism, equality, liberty and fraternity.<br />
2. Secularism stops any single faith to become superior and inferior to those who practicised another religion. Hence it considers all citizens equal irrespective of religious affiliation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. Bring out two major differences between the challenge of nation building for eastern and western regions of the country at the time of Independence.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span> The two major differences between eastern (Bengal) and Western (Punjab) regions can be summed up as follows:<br />
1. These regions were the muslim majority provinces to be joined. Hence, it was decided that new country Pakistan will comprise two territories i.e. West and East Pakistan.<br />
2. Secondly, there was a problem of minorities on both sides of border (East and West). Lakhs of Hindus and Sikhs in areas of Pakistan and Muslims on the Indian side of Punjab and Bengal found themselves trapped with no option except to leave their homes.</p>

2. The State Reorganisation Act was passed in 1956 which resulted the creation of 14 states and 6 union territories.<br />
3. Its most salient recommendation was the formation of linguistic states i.e. to reorganise states on the basis of accommodation of their languages to prepare a uniform base for the nation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>9. It is said that the nation is to large extent an “imagined community” held together by common beliefs, history, political aspirations and imaginations. Identify the features that make India a nation.</strong></span><br />

1. India is a secular country where people speak different languages and follow different cultures and religions to be recognised as a nation of unity in diversity with common faith and beliefs.<br />
2. Political aspiration ensures demo¬cratic setup based on parliamentary form of government creating political competition in a democratic framework.<br />
3. India’s imaginations established a welfare state on the principle of equality and special protection to socially disadvantaged groups and religions as well as cultural communities.</p>

The scale-geographic as well as demographic was comparably massive. The raw material the state had to work with was equally unpropitious: a people divided by faith and driven by debt and disease.”</strong></span><br />
