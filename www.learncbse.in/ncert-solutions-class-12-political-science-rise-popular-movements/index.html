1. This movement focused on issues of sexual violence against women either within family or outside.<br />
2. Women joined the campaign against dowry and demanded personal and property laws based on gender equality.<br />

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. Why did the Narmada Bachao Aandolan oppose the dam projects in the Narmada Valley?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Narmada Bachao Aandolan was a collective local organisationâs movement to save river Narmada which opposed the construction of multi-purpose dam â âThe Narmada Sagar Projectâ and questioned the ongoing developmental projects in country:<br />

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>8. Do movements and protests in a country strengthen democracy? Justify your answer with examples.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Yes, to some extent movements and protests in country strengthen democracy to have mixed reactions both for and against:<br />
Arguments for:<br />
1. Anti-arrack movement, Chipko movement, NBA etc., rectified some problems to be seen as integral part of democratic politics.<br />
2. These movements ensured participation and representation from diverse groups to reduce possibility of deep social conflicts in democracy.<br />
3. These movements broadened the idea of participation in Indian democrac i. e., Anti-arrack movement and Dalit Panthers. Arguments against:<br />
1. Collective actions, rallies, strikes, disrupt the functioning of a democracy and create a delay in decision making.<br />
2. Routine functioning of democracy did not have enough space for the voices of these social groups.<br />
3. It is possible to ignore demand of these movements with the presentation to be represented by one section of society only.<br />
4. Political parties do not seem to be taking up issues of marginal social groups.<br />
5. The relationship between popular movements and political parties has grown weaker over the years creating a vacuum in politics.<br />
Hence, we may conclude that movements are not only about collective assertions or rallies or protest, but they also involve a gradual process of coming together of people with similar problems, demand and expectations.</p>

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>10. Read the passage and answer questions below:</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> &#8230;., nearly all ânew social movementsâ have emerged as corrective to new maladies &#8211; environmental degradation, violation of the status of women, destruction of tribal cultures and the undermining of human rights &#8211; none of which are in and by themselves transformative of the social order.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> They are in that way quite different from revolutionar}1- ideologies of the past. But their weakness lies in their</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> being so heavily fragmented</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> &#8230;a large part of the space occupied by the new social movements seem to be suffering from &#8230; various characteristics which have prevented them from being relevant to the truly oppressed and the poor in the form of a solid unified movement of the people. They are too fragmented, reactive, ad hocish, providing no comprehensive framework of basic social change. Their being anti-this or that (anti-West, anti-capitalist, anti-development, etc.) does not make them any more coherent, any more relevant to oppressed and peripheralized communities.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> -Rajni Kothari</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> (a) What is the difference between new social movements and revolutionary ideologies?</strong></span><br />

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> (c) If social movements address specific issues, would you say that they are âfragmentedâ or that they are more focused? Give reasons for you answer by giving examples.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â (a) The difference is that like revolutionary ideologies none of new social movements are in and by themselves transformative of the social order but they emerged as corrective of new malodies.<br />
(b) According to author these movements are not any more coherent, relevant to oppressed and peripheralised communities. To some extent these are effected by party politics.<br />
(c) If social movements address specific issues, we would say that these are fragmented which provide no comprehensive framework of social change i.e., Anti-arrack movement, Dalit Panthers etc.</p>

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Assess any twoÂ positive aspects of the Chipko Movement.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â (i) The Chipko Movement started in early 1973 in the state that is now Uttarakhand. The movement was unique in the sense that it presented a very unusual form of collective action in which men and women from a village of this state were engaged. These villagers protested against the practices of commercial logging that the government had permitted. They used a novel tactic for their protestâ that of hugging the trees to prevent them from being cut down. The struggle soon spread across many parts of the Uttarakhand region.<br />
(ii) Womenâs active participation in the Chipko agitation was a very novel aspect of the movement. The forest contractors of the region usually doubled up as suppliers of alcohol to men. Women held sustained agitations against the habit of alcoholism and broadened the agenda of the movement to cover other social issues. The movement achieved a victory when the government issued a ban on felling of trees in the Himalayan region for fifteen years, until the green cover was fully restored.</p>

Social movements in India have been involved in these educative tasks for a long time and have thus contributed to expansion of democracy rather than causing disruptions.</strong><br />

<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Suppose you are an important leader of the Farmersâ agitation. The government authorities ask you to present any three demands on behalf of the farmers. On priority basis, which three demands will you make? Support your demands with appropriate arguments.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Farmersâ agitation is not new in our country. It has been in existence time to time for particular goals. We know that the Indian farmers have been the worst sufferers in the country. They are the backbone of the country in development, yet they are not given much attention. Governments come and go, but the tragedy of our farmers remain the same. Being the leader of the farmersâ agitation I have several demands in my mind for the benefit of the poor farmers but here I would mention only three demands on their behalf:<br />
(i) Proper banking facilities so that farmers should not depend on the village moneylenders who give them money at a very high rate. Most of the time the poor farmers fall into debt trap which make their life a hell.<br />
(ii) Proper irrigation facilities in case there is poor/weak monsoon.<br />
(ii) Insurance of crops will save farmers from committing suicide. The unexpected rain in the months of March and April this year devastated the standing crops in the field. The natureâs fury aggravated the miseries of the farmers some of whom could not bear and committed suicide.</p>
