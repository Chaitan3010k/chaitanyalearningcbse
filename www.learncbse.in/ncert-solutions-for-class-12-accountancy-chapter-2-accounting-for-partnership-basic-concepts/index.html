<p><strong>Situation IV</strong> When different amount is at different intervals<br />
When different amount is withdrawn by a partner at different dates then the interest is calculated by product method. The period of drawings is calculated from the date of withdrawal to the last date of the accounting year,<br />
e.g., A partner withdraws?6,000 on March 01, Rs.4,000 on June 01, Rs.5,000 on Aug 30 and Rs.2,000 on Nov 30 and the rate of interest on drawings is 12% pa. The firm closes its book on December 31.<br />

<p><strong>Question 5</strong>. How will you deal with a change in profit sharing ratio among existing partners? Take imaginary figures to illustrate your answer.<br />
<strong>Answer</strong> Change in the profit sharing ratio occurs only in case of the admission, retirement or death of a partner or sometimes due to the general agreement among the partners in which they may decide to change the profit sharing ratio. There may be number of issues that should be considered during the change in the profit sharing ratio such as goodwill, reserves and accumulated profits, profit or loss on the revaluation of assets and liabilities and adjustment of capital, etc.<br />
As far as the issue related to general reserve is concerned it is basically the accumulated profits (if any) and profit (or loss) on revaluation of assets and liabilities and should be distributed in the partner&#8217;s capital account in partners old profit sharing ratio.<br />
Sometimes the existing partners may decide to change the profit sharing ratio then some partners gain at the cost of other partners. In other words one partner gain and other one sacrifice equal to the gain. In that case the former should compensate the latter. Therefore, the gaining partner&#8217;s capital account&#8217;s are debited to the extent of their gain and sacrificing partner’s capital accounts are credited to the extent of their sacrifice .The following journal entry is passed<br />

<p><strong>Example</strong> Ram. Mohan and Shyam are partners in a firm sharing profit and loss in 3 2 :1 ratio. They decide to share profit and loss equally in future. On dm: date, the books of the firm showsRs.2.40.000 as general reserve, profit on ^evaluation of Plant and Machinery Rs.60.000. The following adjustment entry is passed through the capital accounts without affecting the books of accounts.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-118706" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Accountancy-Chapter-2-Accounting-for-Partnership-Basic-Concepts-LAQ-Q5.1.png" alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 12 Accountancy Chapter 2 Accounting for Partnership Basic Concepts LAQ Q5.1" width="476" height="157" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Accountancy-Chapter-2-Accounting-for-Partnership-Basic-Concepts-LAQ-Q5.1.png 476w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-12-Accountancy-Chapter-2-Accounting-for-Partnership-Basic-Concepts-LAQ-Q5.1-300x99.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 476px) 100vw, 476px" /><br />
