<p><strong>Question.9. How did cultural processes help in creating a sense of collective belongingness in India? Explain.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Though nationalism spread through the experience of united struggle but a variety of cultural processes captured the imagination of Indians and promoted a sense of collective belongingness:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use of figures or images. The identity of India came to be visually associated with the image of Bharat Mata. Devotion to the mother figure came to be seen as an evidence of one&#8217;s nationalism.</li>
<li> Indian folklore. Nationalists started recording and using folklores and tales, which they believed, gave a true picture of traditional culture that had been corrupted and damaged by outside forces. So preservation of these became a way to discover one&#8217;s national identity and restore a sense of price in one&#8217;s past.</li>
<li>Use of icons and symbols in the form of flags. Carrying the tricolour flag and holding it aloft during marches became a symbol of defiance and promoted a sense of collective belonging.</li>
<li>Reinterpretation of history.

<p><strong>Question.16. How do democratic governments ensure transparency? Explain any three points.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Democracy ensures that decision-making will be based on norms and procedures. So a citizen, who wants to know if a decision was taken through the correct procedures, can find out as democracy guarantees to the citizens the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making.</li>
<li> In a democracy people have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over them. Whenever possible and necessary, citizens should be able to participate in decision-making that affects them all. Thus it ensures transparency by producing a government that is accountable to the citizens and is responsive to their needs and expectations.</li>
<li> It is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to people.

</ol>
<p><strong>Question.17. Explain with examples why some laws that seek to ban something are not very successful in politics.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Law has an important role to play in political reform. Carefully devised changes in law can help to discourage wrong political practices and encourage good ones. But legal constitutional changes by themselves are not effective, until carried out by political activists, parties, movements and politically conscious citizens.<br />
Any legal change must carefully look at what results it will have on politics. Sometimes it can be counter-productive. For example, many states have banned people who have more than two children from contesting panchayat elections. This has resulted in denial of democratic opportunity to many poor men and women.<br />
The best laws are those which empower the people to carry out democratic reforms. The Right to Information Act is a good example that supplements the existing laws. “Any law for political reforms is a good solution but who will implement it and how&#8221; — is the question. It is not necessary that the legislators will pass legislations that go against the interests of the political parties and MPs.</p>

For example, densely populated countries like China, Bangladesh and India have ample labour and provide the advantage of cheap manufacturing locations.</li>
<li>MNCs also need close-by markets for their manufactured goods. Mexico and Eastern Europe are useful for their closeness to the markets in the US and Europe.</li>
<li>Besides these, MNCs also require skilled engineers and IT personnels and a large number of English speaking people who are able to provide customer care services. In addition, MNCs might look for government policies that look after their interests.</li>

<p><strong>Question.27. What is the basic objective of &#8216;Self Help Groups&#8217;? Describe any four advantages of &#8216;Self Help Groups&#8217; for the poor.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> The basic objective of &#8216;Self Help Groups&#8217; is to organize rural poor, particularly women belonging to one neighbourhood into small Self Help Groups (15-20 members). These members save regularly and the amount varies from ?25-100 or more.<br />
<strong>The four advantages of &#8216;Self Help Groups&#8217; are as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> The members can take small loans from the group itself to meet their needs. The group charges interest on these loans which is still less than what moneylenders charge.</li>
<li> After a year or two, if the group is regular in savings, it becomes eligible for availing loan from the bank which is sanctioned in the name of the group to create self employment opportunities.<br />
For instance, small loans are provided to the members for releasing mortgaged land, meeting working capital needs, for acquiring assets like sewing machines, handlooms, cattle etc.</li>
<li> Banks are willing to lend to the poor women when organized in SHGs, even though they have no collateral as such. Thus, the SHGs help women to become financially self reliant.</li>
<li> The regular meetings of the group provide a platform to discuss and act on a variety of social issues such as health, nutrition, domestic violence etc.</li>

<p><strong>Question.28. (a) Explain two reasons responsible for enacting &#8216;Consumer Protection Act 1986 by the Government of India.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Consumers have the right to be informed about goods and services they purchase. Explain its three advantages.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) The &#8216;Consumer Protection Act, 1986&#8217; was enacted:</p>
<ul>
<li> to protect consumers in the market place and promote the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices like rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing over pricing, adulteration of food and edible oil.</li>
<li>to stop big companies from manipulating the market by giving false information through media, thereby exploiting the consumers.</li>
<li>to give rights to consumers to represent in the Consumer Court and seek redressal against unfair trade practices and exploitation.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) It is mandatory for the manufacturer to display certain details on the packing because consumers have the right to be informed about the particulars of goods and services they purchase. These details are about ingredients used, price, quantity, quality, potency, batch number, date of manufacture, expiry date and the address of the manufacturer.<br />
<strong>The advantages of this rule are:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Consumers can use this information to complain and ask for compensation or replacement if the product proves to be defective in any manner. For example, if we buy a product and find it defective well within the expiry period, we can ask for a replacement. If the expiry period was not printed, the manufacturer would blame the shopkeeper and will not accept the responsibility.</li>
<li> One can protest and&#8217;complain if someone sells a good at more than the printed price on the packet. This is indicated by &#8216;MRF—maximum retail price. In fact if the MRP is missing from the packing, a consumer can bargain with the seller to sell at less than the MRP.</li>
<li>In October 2005, the Government of India enacted a law known as RTI (Right to Information) Act, which ensures its citizens all the information about the functions of government departments. The RTI Act gives consumers the power to question the government about the functions and various services provided by the government.</li>

<p><strong>Question.17. &#8220;Legal constitutional changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy.&#8221; Explain with example.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer. </strong>As legal constitutional changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy, democratic reforms need to be carried out mainly by political activists, parties, movements and politically conscious citizens.</p>
<ol>
<li>Any legal change must carefully look at what results it will have on politics. Generally, laws that seek a ban on something are rather counter-productive;<br />
For example, many states have, debarred people who have more than two children from contesting Panchayat elections. This has resulted in denial of democratic opportunity to many poor women, which was not intended. The best laws are those which empower people to carry out democratic reforms; for example, the Right to Information Act which acts as a watchdog of democracy by controlling corruption.</li>
<li> Democratic reforms are to be brought about principally through political parties. The most important concern should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens.</li>
<li> Any proposal for political reforms should think not only about what is a good solution, but also about who will implement it and how. Measures that rely on democratic movements, citizens&#8217; organizations and media are likely to succeed.</li>

<li> Establishing industries in tribal and backward areas help in bringing down regional disparities.</li>
<li>Export of manufactured goods expands trade and commerce and brings in much needed foreign exchange.</li>
<li>Industrial development brings prosperity to the country as it transforms raw materials into valuable products.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Question.28. How do the large companies often manipulate the markets? Explain with an example.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> The big companies eliminate their competitors by lowering down the price of products thereby establishing their monopolies in the market giving less choice to people.<br />
The large companies with huge wealth, power and reach often manipulate the market in various ways. Some common ways by which consumers are exploited in the market are :</p>
<ol>
<li> Goods sold in the market are sometimes not measured or weighed correctly.</li>
<li> The goods sold are sometimes of sub-standard quality, For example, selling medicines beyond their date of expiry.</li>
<li> In costly edible items such as oil, ghee etc. adulteration is common.</li>
<li> At times false information is passed on through the media and other sources to attract consumers.<br />
For example, a company for years sold powder milk for babies all over the world as the most scientific product claiming it to be better than mother&#8217;s milk. It took years of struggle before the company was forced to accept that it had been making false claims.<br />
Similarly, a long battle had to be fought with court cases to make cigarette manufacturing companies accept that their product could cause cancer.</li>

<li>The growing consumption of energy has resulted in India becoming increasingly dependent on fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas which are found in limited quantity on the earth.</li>
<li> Rising prices of oil and gas and their potential shortages have raised uncertainties about the security of energy supply in future, which in turn has serious repercussions on the growth of the national economy.</li>
<li>Increasing use of fossil fuels also causes serious environmental degradation like air pollution, water pollution etc.<br />
So there is an urgent need to use sustainable energy resources like solar, water, wind, tide biomass etc.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.14. How are integrated steel plants different from mini steel plants? 3*1=3</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> An integrated steel plant is large, handles everything in one complex—from putting together raw material to steel making, rolling and shaping. An integrated steel plant uses a b’ast furnace and iron-ore as raw material.<br />
Mini steel plants are smaller, have electric furnaces, use steel scrap and sponge iron. They have re-rollers that use steel in gots as well. They produce mild and alloy steel of given specifications.</p>
<p><strong>Question.25. The movement in Nepal and the struggle in Bolivia have some elements relevant to the study of democracy. Explain these elements.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> The movement in Nepal was to establish democracy, while the struggle in Bolivia involved claims on an elected democratic government. Despite the differences, both these struggles share some elements relevant to study of democracies.</p>
<ol>
<li> Both these are instances of political conflict that led to popular struggles. The Nepalese movement arose with the specific objective of reversing the King&#8217;s order that led to the dismissal of the Prime Minister and the dissolution of the popularly elected Parliament.<br />
In Bolivia, the struggle was against the privatization and increase in prices of water after the government sold these rights to an MNC.</li>
<li> In both cases, the struggle involved mass mobilization. The popular struggle in the form of a protest turned into an indefinite strike. In Nepal, all major political parties in Parliament formed a Seven Party Alliance and called a four-day strike which turned into an indefinite strike in which the Maoists and insurgent groups joined hands.<br />
In the Bolivian struggle against privatization of water, an alliance of labour human rights and community leaders organized a successful four-day general strike.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.27. Give the meaning of WTO? What is the major aim of WTO? Mention any two shortcomings of WTO? </strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> WTO (World Trade Organization). WTO believes that there should not be any barriers between trade of different countries. Trade between countries should be free.<br />
<strong>Aims of WTO:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> To liberalize international trade.</li>
<li>To establish rules regarding international trade.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong> Two shortcomings of WTO:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Though WTO is supposed to allow free trade for all, in practice, it is seen that the developed countries have unfairly retained trade barriers and continued to provide protection to their producers. For example, farmers in the US receive huge sums of money from the government and as a result can sell the farm products at abnormally low prices in other countries, adversely affecting farmers in those countries.</li>
<li>On the other hand WTO ruies have forced the developing countries to remove trade barriers.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question.28. What is &#8216;Consumer Protection Act&#8217;? Explain any three reasons responsible of enacting &#8216;Consumer Protection Act, 1986&#8217; by the Government of India.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Consumer Protection Act. The COPRA was enacted to protect and promote the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices.<br />
The rationale behind COPRA (Consumer Protection Act) is to provide the consumers the means to redressal at three levels of quasi-judicial courts—District Forum, State Consumer Courts and National Commission.<br />
This Act has enabled the consumers to have a right to represent themselves in the consumer courts.<br />
The ‘Consumer Protection Act, 1986&#8242; was enacted:</p>
<ul>
<li>to protect consumers in the market place and promote the interests of consumers against unethical and unfair trade practices like rampant food shortages, hoarding, black marketing, over pricing, adulteration of food and edible oil.</li>
<li>to stop big companies from manipulating the market by giving false information through media, thereby exploiting the consumers.</li>
<li>to give rights to consumers to represent in the Consumer Court and seek redressal against unfair trade practices and exploitation.</li>
</ul>
