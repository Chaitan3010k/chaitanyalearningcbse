<p><strong>                                                               SECTION A &#8211; Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    When a storm with a wind speed of 92 km ph raged across Delhi, the first effect of it was be that power went off. The city witnessed power cuts from four to seven hours after several transmission lines tripped due to the devastating winds blowing across the city; Calling discoms was futile as telephone lines were jammed or even get broken down due to the storm in several homes, the power back up too went off due to such a long gap.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    But the greatest danger came from the falling of roadside trees. Branches of trees fell like sticks, crushing cars falling in their path. This was because several of these trees have now become old and unable to withstand the fury of the storm. Their crowns are now too broad to carry the weight of their trunks. People too, were left in a state of utter shock. Activists and tree experts blamed the falling of trees to the concrete choking trees around the city, leaving them weak from inside. Also, the groundwater level is very deep and most of the trees cannot soak the rain water as the concrete surround has blocked the entry of rainwater.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Another common casualty of the storm was the falling down of signage and scaffolding on passing traffic. In the bargain the storm brought a ton of bricks as the pillars of the top floor collapsed/injuring people below. In another bizarre happening a woman flew off the terrace of the home and hit a woman below. Road signage collapsed and fell on parked cars.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    The storm had been caused by a huger cumulonimbus cloud cell located over Delhi. The cell with a height of 14 km, cut Delhi in half stretching from north-west to the north-east. South, southwest and west Delhi areas fell in the tail end where the cloud managed to raise a lot of dust, but led to strong winds. In the east, north east and northern parts, wind speed and squall was lower but these areas recorded rain.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    What was the wind speed of the storm and what was its effect?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What followed the power cuts?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What turned out to be the greatest danger? Why?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    What reason was attributed to the falling of trees?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    What reason are activists giving for the falling of trees?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    Why can these trees not take in rainwater?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    How was passing traffic affected by the storm?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    How was the storm caused?</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Formal menswear has always been branded as boring, whereas women&#8217;s formal wear is always in the forefront when it comes to style. In recent times clothing brands have taken it upon themselves to cast aside the sedate and boring label and take the innovative route. This has resulted in the creation of what is being dubbed &#8216;smart clothes for men&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Instead of the erstwhile rigidity of stitched-to-size, smart clothes, men now have a different take altogether. These clothes are geared to adjust to the shape of the wearer&#8217;s figure. Hence the day is not far when a shirt collar would automatically adjust itself to fit individual neck sizes and full size suits could be packed to the size of a laptop. This will enable frequent flyers to travel light. To counter the menace of sweaty clothes, smart clothing is being specially woven into dress shirts that help office goers remain fresh ail through the summer.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    The thrust towards creating this line of men&#8217;s clothing has been fueled by the greatest names in the industry. Popular menswear brands are not stopping at innovative conveniences in formal wear, but are now adopting a vigorous marketing campaign alongside. Continuous innovations have allowed these brands to buck economic slowdown and grow their products in the last few years.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Realising the need to adapt to offer solutions that will suit Indian lifestyles, they are now geared into making clothing lines that offer solutions to the Indian consumer. Hence with so many people flying abroad for business, the Indian lightweight suit is crumple-free and a necessity for the Indian consumer. Others manufacturers are flaunting lightweight suits that weigh less than 500 gm. Beyond the pale is a vast range of ever-clean shirts and travel-friendly trousers.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5    Other fashion houses are concentrating their energies on materials, by developing innovative fabrics and devising treatments. These include fabric that nourishes the skin of the wearer due to the aloe vera treatment of the micro fibre.</span><br />

<p><strong>                                                                    SECTION A &#8211; Reading</strong></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">1.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    When a storm with a wind speed of 92 km ph raged across Delhi, the first effect of it was be that power went off. The city witnessed power cuts from four to seven hours after several transmission lines tripped due to the devastating winds blowing across the city; Calling discoms was futile as telephone lines were jammed or even get broken down due to the storm in several homes, the power back up too went off due to such a long gap.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    But the greatest danger came from the falling of roadside trees. Branches of trees fell like sticks, crushing cars falling in their path. This was because several of these trees have now become old and unable to withstand the fury of the storm. Their crowns are now too broad to carry the weight of their trunks. People too, were left in a state of utter shock. Activists and tree experts blamed the falling of trees to the concrete choking trees around the city, leaving them weak from inside. Also, the groundwater level is very deep and most of the trees cannot soak the rain water as the concrete surround has blocked the entry of rainwater.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    Another common casualty of the storm was the falling down of signage and scaffolding on passing traffic. In the bargain the storm brought a ton of bricks as the pillars of the top floor collapsed/injuring people below. In another bizarre happening a woman flew off the terrace of the home and hit a woman below. Road signage collapsed and fell on parked cars.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    The storm had been caused by a huger cumulonimbus cloud cell located over Delhi. The cell with a height of 14 km, cut Delhi in half stretching from north-west to the north-east. South, southwest and west Delhi areas fell in the tail end where the cloud managed to raise a lot of dust, but led to strong winds. In the east, north east and northern parts, wind speed and squall was lower but these areas recorded rain.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Q. On the basis of your reading of the above passage answer the following questions.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    What was the wind speed of the storm and what was its effect?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    What followed the power cuts?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    What turned out to be the greatest danger? Why?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    What reason was attributed to the falling of trees?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    What reason are activists giving for the falling of trees?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    Why can these trees not take in rainwater?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    How was passing traffic affected by the storm?</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)    How was the storm caused?</span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">(a) The wind speed of the storm was 92 km ph and it affected the power supply of Delhi.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    Following the power cuts, several transmission lines tripped and as telephone lines were jammed or even get broken down discoms could not be reached.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    The greatest danger turned out to be the falling of roadside trees, causing great danger to cars on the road.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    The trees fell because several of them have now become old and their crowns are now too broad to carry the weight of their trunks.</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8216;(e) According to activists and tree experts the falling of trees was because the concrete surrounds of the trees was choking them, leaving them weak from inside.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(f)    The trees are unable to take in rainwater because groundwater level is very deep and the concrete surround of the trunks has blocked the entry of rainwater.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(g)    Passing traffic was affected by falling of signag and scaffolding and the coming down of bricks from construction sites.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(h)   The storm was caused by a huger cumulonimbus cloud cell located at a height of 1.4 km above Delhi.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">2.    Read the following passage carefully.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">1    Formal menswear has always been branded as boring, whereas women&#8217;s formal wear is always in the forefront when it comes to style. In recent times clothing brands have taken it upon themselves to cast aside the sedate and boring label and take the innovative route. This has resulted in the creation of what is being dubbed &#8216;smart clothes for men&#8217;.</span><br />
<span class="font5">2    Instead of the erstwhile rigidity of stitched-to-size, smart clothes, men now have a different take altogether. These clothes are geared to adjust to the shape of the wearer&#8217;s figure. Hence the day is not far when a shirt collar would automatically adjust itself to fit individual neck sizes and full size suits could be packed to the size of a laptop. This will enable frequent flyers to travel light. To counter the menace of sweaty clothes, smart clothing is being specially woven into dress shirts that help office goers remain fresh ail through the summer.</span><br />
<span class="font5">3    The thrust towards creating this line of men&#8217;s clothing has been fueled by the greatest names in the industry. Popular menswear brands are not stopping at innovative conveniences in formal wear, but are now adopting a vigorous marketing campaign alongside. Continuous innovations have allowed these brands to buck economic slowdown and grow their products in the last few years.</span><br />
<span class="font5">4    Realising the need to adapt to offer solutions that will suit Indian lifestyles, they are now geared into making clothing lines that offer solutions to the Indian consumer. Hence with so many people flying abroad for business, the Indian lightweight suit is crumple-free and a necessity for the Indian consumer. Others manufacturers are flaunting lightweight suits that weigh less than 500 gm. Beyond the pale is a vast range of ever-clean shirts and travel-friendly trousers.</span><br />
<span class="font5">5    Other fashion houses are concentrating their energies on materials, by developing innovative fabrics and devising treatments. These include fabric that nourishes the skin of the wearer due to the aloe vera treatment of the micro fibre.</span><br />
<span class="font5">6 The upwardly mobile male in the age group of 25-35 is the ideal consumer of these innovations as he is the biggest category of spender in the formal menswear range. For them, the yardstick is hitched a notch higher for not only do they demand all the above in their clothing but also a conscious striving after functionality. No matter how innovative the suit might be, unless it is functional as well, buyers for it will not be forthcoming.</span><br />

<strong><span class="font5">Subject: </span></strong><span class="font5">Encroachment of public parks for ticketed cultural performances</span><br />
<span class="font5">Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I wish to bring to the notice of the readers the menace of hiring out residential parks for ticketed performances. Since a month the neighbourhood park opposite Mohalla Mohanpur has been turned into an open-air stage for holding star nights and ticketed cultural performances by visiting troupes.</span><br />
<span class="font5">These performances continue late into the evening causing much disquiet in the locality and gross inconvenience to the residents. Police security and public numbers have swelled exorbitantly making the area vulnerable. Cases of minor thefts, altercations between the organisers and neighbourhood representatives are becoming common occurrences.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Most importantly, these makeshift venues have deprived children of a safe playing area and they are now forced to make the streets and footpaths their playground. This is a serious hazard to their lives and the safety of motorists.</span><br />
<span class="font5">It is urged that immediate remedial steps are taken by the concerned authorities .</span><br />

<span class="font5">The National Museum at New Delhi is a virtual brick-and-mortar history book as the museum houses artifacts covering 5000 years of Indian history. Located at the junction of Janpath and Maulana Azad Road, its red sandstone structure was planned under the Gwyer Committee that had been set up in 1946. It was inaugurated on Independence Day, 1949, by the then Governor-General of India, C Rajagopalachari.</span><br />
<span class="font5">The artifacts at the museum are now housed according to different segments or galleries, but the most fascinating segment of the museum for us was the Indus Valley civilization gallery as we are currently studying about that time. Seeing the pottery, jewellery and figurines of the period made us realize how advanced the people of that civilization were. Our teacher pointed out Chola and Satavahana relics as we would be studying about them in the next term.</span><br />
<span class="font5">We emerged from this two-storey treasury of more than 200,000 artefacts feeling proud to be Indian.</span></p>

<strong><span class="font5">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">The Louvre Museum in Paris was holding an International Students Week.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">It was 5.05 p.m. when the storm broke over the city. Immediately, we were left with no power and the television blanked out. I would miss the crucial match telecast live from the stadium. I rang up the complaints department, but the telephone lines were jammed. Was everyone in the country glued to their sets watching Renaldo perform miracles?</span><br />
<span class="font5">In the twilight, I heard voices outside. It was our neighbours who had come out into the open and were chatting with other neighbours. Before long, there were people from every house gathered in the open space. Bholu&#8217;s grandfather, Dadaji, began to narrate stories about how they used to study under lantern lights and how instead of electricity bulbs they had used gas lights. Soon, other elders began narrating their escapades and my grandmother spoke about how she learnt making chapattis.</span><br />
<span class="font5">The thought reminded us about dinner, but every house reported a partially cooked meal. Then the vote was taken to pool all the food together and hold a pot luck party. There was sambar and idli from one home and parathas from another, while aunty Mary served us a delicious slices of cake and my grandmother pulled out some special treat. We snored and dosed all night under a cool star-lit sky.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">While visiting Paris I had taken a day off to see the Louvre Museum on my own. At the ticket counter, one of the officials, casually enquired if I knew about &#8216;The Three Ladies&#8217; housed in the museum. I recalled what our art teacher had told us about Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci which was on display at the Louvre.</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8220;One of them is Mona Lisa,&#8217; I shot off.</span><br />
<span class="font5">The official smiled. &#8216;The other two?&#8217; he enquired.</span><br />
<span class="font5">I recalled that these museums had plenty of Roman and Greek sculptures and the most well known was the Winged Victory of Samothrace.</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8216;What about the third lady?&#8217; enquired the official.    .</span><br />
<span class="font5">We had read the story in class about the unfortunate man who thought himself to be the lost arms of the statue of Venus de Milo and I made her my third choice.</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8216;Bravo Monsieur&#8217;beamed the official.&#8217;You win a free pass to the Museum&#8217;</span><br />
<span class="font5">At once the whole place erupted with claps as tourists and officials shouted their congratulations in Spanish, German, Japanese, Italian and French. I acknowledged the congratulations with a Namaskar</span></p>

<p><span class="font5"><strong>9.    Answer any four of the following questions    in 30-40 words each.  </strong>  </span><br />
<span class="font5">(a)    &#8220;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings&#8221;.why does Ozymandias refer to himself as king of kings? what </span><span class="font5">quality of the king is revealed through this statement?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)    Why does John wish he were dead?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    How do Brutus and Cassius respond to Antony&#8217;s speech?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Does the poet in the poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; agree with his voice initially?    </span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    What genre of stories does Jenkins want the author to write? Why?    </span><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">(a) Ozymandias thought himself to be a powerful king, a ruler of the earth. He considered himself to be immortal </span><span class="font5">and thought that nothing could destroy him. His false sense of pride and power are reflected in these lines.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(b)John&#8217;s wife Lavinia had told him that she was going back to her grandmother and her lawyer would </span><span class="font5">communicate with him later. Actually she was upset about the previous night&#8217;s events. While asking questions using an Ouija board, the ghost of Helen appeared and told him that he was a traitor and had deceived someone. This instigated Lavinia and she threatened to leave him.    _</span><br />
<span class="font5">(c)    Brutus was a close associate and friend of Caesar&#8217;s. He was a republican and a great patriot To him, his country and countrymen held great importance. But, he was a gullible person who couldn&#8217;t judge people. He easily believed Cassius when he told him that Caesar was a threat to Rome as he was an ambitious man and he wanted to make Romans his slaves. So, for the love of his country and countrymen Brutus killed Caesar.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(d)    Lawrence was most distrustful of the voices of his education. He therefore, didn&#8217;t agree with his voice initially that the snake should be killed. He went along with his conscience which said that the snakie was a guest at his water trough.</span><br />
<span class="font5">(e)    Jenkins wanted the author to write short stories about supernatural things. He had desired such stories as the reading public were keen to read stories that gave them &#8216;the horrors&#8217; and the ghost characters in the author&#8217;s stories appeared live propositions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">10. Answer the following question in about 80-100 words each.</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">Patol Babu&#8217;s wife says, &#8216;Counting your chickens again before they&#8217;re hatched, are you? No wonder you could never   </span><span class="font5">make a go of it.&#8217; Do you feel that people who presume success before it comes to them are the ones whom success </span><span class="font5">always alludes? Elaborate.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">&#8216;Time is all powerful, time is sluttish.&#8217; What does Shelley teach us about mighty rulers and the passage of time in Ozymandias.</span><br />
<strong>Ans.<span class="font5">Value Points:</span></strong><br />
<span class="font5">•    Man should believe not in word but in actions.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    We should prove our mettle through our deeds.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    One&#8217;s work is an evidence of our hard work and potential.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    One who speaks but doesn&#8217;t act is a shallow person with no capability.</span><br />
<span class="font5">•    We should be eager to do our jobs and involve ourselves totally in the task assigned to us.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">P.B. Shelley&#8217;s reflective sonnet captures the theme of the impermanence of time and the mutability of life and transience of power. As a romantic, Shelley felt the poet should be an arbiter of mortality and political order. Thus his verses communicate the fallacy of many a powerful ruler that they will be immortalized in history. Ozymandias was a powerful Egyptian Pharaoh, once worshipped as a God, now long dead and his mighty statue has broken and isolated in the desert. Time destroys everythings, nothing remains forever. The beauty of Shelley&#8217;s language which conveys both meaning and image, &#8216;boundless and bare lone and level, evoke the empty expanse of the desert and a forgotten time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">                                                     <strong>Attempt any one — Part A or Part B</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span class="font5">                                                                                 Part A    </span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">11. What opinion does Anne form of herself in the chapters?    .</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Anne&#8217;s friend Lies.  </span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><span class="font5">Anne felt that she was the best and sharpest critic of her own work. She was confident about assessing what was well-written and what was not She bemoaned the fact that she couldn&#8217;t draw. She wanted to be a working lady. She wanted to develop her art of writing and express all that was in her. She could shake off everything if she wrote: her sorrows disappeared, her courage was reborn. Anne felt that she had an indefatigable spirit. She felt that she was a curious girl who wanted to know a lot about the unexplored world. She felt that she was very talkative too. She found herself moody at times. She thought that she had a good presence of mind but at the same time she felt she was not as intelligent as her sister Margot. She felt she was not as beautiful as Margot. But Anne had high aspirations in her life. She didn&#8217;t want to sit at home doing nothing. She wanted to go to Paris and move around the world.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Anne and Lies were good friends who went to school together. They both had to leave the Montessori school and join the Jewish school. Lies and her parents couldn&#8217;t manage to go into hiding. They were sent to Westerbork and later on in the concentration camps, Lies&#8217; mother fell ill and her father also died. Lies got to know that in the next block of her camp some prisoners were brought and Margot and Anne Frank were among them. Lies went over the barbed wire and went to meet Anne. Both of them were very weak and cried upon seeing each other. She got a little extra food and clothing across the fence to Anne.</span><br />
<strong><span class="font5">                                                                                  Part B</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">11. How did Helen feel that a visit to Midway Plaisance was like the Arabian Nights?</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Or</span></strong><br />
<strong><span class="font5">Draw a character sketch of Dr. Graham Bell.</span></strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<span class="font5">The &#8216;Arabian Nights&#8217; relates the stories of love and adventure. They are full of novelty and interest. Helen could cover different places at one place. She saw India with its Shivas and Elephant Gods. There was the land of the Pyramids concentrated in a model, Cairo with it mosques and its long processions of camels. There were the lagoons of Venice also. She went on board a Viking ship which lay a short distance from the little craft. She touched the diamonds and everything fascinated her, especially the French bronzes. &#8220;They were so lifelike, I thought they were angel visions which the artist had caught and bound in earthly forms&#8221;. A little distance from the ship there was a model of the Santa Maria, which she also examined. The captain showed her Columbus&#8217;s cabin and the desk with an hour-glass on it. The small instrument impressed her the most because it made her think how weary the heroic navigator must have felt as he saw the sand dropping grain by grain while desperate men were plotting against his life. She was fascinated with everything as it was like a dream. So, she said that Midway Pleasance was like the Arabian Nights.</span><br />
<span class="font5">Or</span><br />
<span class="font5">Helen Keller held Dr Graham Bell in high esteem. Keller sensed Bell&#8217;s tender disposition. As a child, Helen felt tenderness and sympathy for Dr. Bell. He was a wonderful person with wonderful achievements. He was admired by all. &#8216;The Story of My Life&#8217;, is dedicated to him. Keller met him first when she was six years old. She was brought to him by her parents for advice on how to teach her. Dr Bell guided them to contact the Perkins Institution for the blind. They followed his advice. There was a good bond of friendship between Dr. Bell and Helen Keller. He remained a friend to Anne Sullivan also. He accompanied them on a trip to the World Fair. Dr Bell had a humorous and poetic side too. His dominating passion was his love for children.</span><br />
