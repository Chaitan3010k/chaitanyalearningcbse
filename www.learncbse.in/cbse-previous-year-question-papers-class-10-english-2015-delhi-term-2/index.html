<p>Question 3.<br />
One of the key messages of the Prime Minister&#8217;s Independence Day speech was &#8216;Clean India&#8217;. The Government has taken an initiative for cleaning the rivers especially &#8216;The Ganges&#8217;. The Government has also urged the people of India to realise the dream of &#8216;Clean India&#8217;.Write an article in 100 &#8211; 120 words mentioning the measures people can take for a cleaner and greener India. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
A CLEANER GREENER INDIA<br />
By xyz<br />
Our prime minister&#8217;s speech on Independence day was basically based on cleaner and greener India. He has especially taken an initiative to clean the Ganges which is one of the most important water ways of India. Steps the inception of the project a lot of positive stpes have been taken. Many of the bathing ghats have been spruced up. In fact, the city of Vamasi it self has a new look. However, a similar initiative must have been taken all along the river front, including places like Kanpur and Allahabad. First of all, people should develop the &#8216;civic sense&#8217;. People should be taught to think beyond their homes. They should have feeling of patriotism. A fine must imposed on those who deface the river. NGO&#8217;s could be roped in to contirbute to the cleaning mission.<br />
It is the time that we should take concrete measures to revive the ancient glory of India. Our motherland India must beckon to other countries as a model of progress and development. Let&#8217;s build up a clean and green India.</p>

Answer:<br />
It was a quite, cold and dark night like it usually is in winter when all retire to bed early. Suddenly, at the dead of night, a shreik jerked the people in the building out of their beds. It was distinctly the voice of a ghostly creature who seemed to have come to haunt the house.<br />
My mother and father heard the voice and were terribly shaken. They tried to calm us and made us sleep. However, all the neighbours came rushing and curious to find out whose voice it was. The whole experience was uncanny and frightening.</p>
<p>People in fear ran downstairs. There was an absolute pandemonium especially near the lifts, wanting to go to the ground floor. Finally, two of the residents caught the mysterious figure. It turned out to be an eight year old boy who was playing a mischievous prank to scare the residents.<br />
Moral: Look Before You Leap.<br />
OR<br />
I belong to a very poor family. My parents have not had the benefit of an education and are humble labourers. Their only dream was to see me well placed in a good job. They worked overtime in order to fulfill my coveted dream — to crack the National Talent Search Examination.</p>
<p>&#8216; I burnt the midnight oil and worked all through the night. My hard work paid off and I secured consistly good marks. This made my parents smile.</p>
<p>I could not afford to go for tuitions. However, I was more than lucky that I had a good teacher to help me. Mrs. Seth clarified my doubts and helped me in every possible way. Another advantage I had was the access to a well stocked library. It was close to my house and the librarian Mrs. Seema was very helpful.</p>
<p>I was nervous and apprehensive on the day of the exam. With all my painstaking preparation the paper was well-done. After the result announced. I got to know that I was among the top 10 candidates who qualified the exam. I was on cloud nine.</p>

(d) Do you think M. Loisel had an enjoyable evening at the ball ? Give reasons for your answer.<br />

(b) When Maxwell took Mijbil to the bathroom, he was plainly delighted. For half an hour he went wild with joy in the water. He plunged and rolled in it making enough slosh and splash for a hippo.

(c) Bholi was sent to school as she had ugly face, lack of sense and little chance of her getting married.<br />
(d) No M. Loisel did not have an enjoyable evening at the ball, rather he was quite bored with the ball, as he had been half asleep in one of the little salons since midnight with three other gentlemen whose wives were enjoying themselves very much.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Answer the following question in 80-100 words: [1 × 4 = 4]<br />
&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I can get on by myself.&#8221; &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to help me, &#8220;said Valli to the conductor. She shows extraordinary courage in making the bus journey all alone. Taking inspiration from Valli&#8217;s character, write how ability and courage to take rist are essential to fulfill one&#8217;s dream.<br />
OR<br />
&#8220;Put the fear out of your heart and you will be able to speak like anyone else.&#8221; These words of encouragement from the teacher highlight that change of social attitude and encouragement can help a child like Bholi to become confident and face the world bravely. Taking help from the lesson, &#8216;Bholi&#8217; write how the social attitude towards Bholi made her an introvert. What should be done to help such children to face the world bravely ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Valli was an eight year old girl and was very curious about the world around her. She sat at the front door of her house watching all the different activities. She did not have friends of her own age.</p>
<p>One of the things that fascinated her the most was the bus that travelled between her village and the nearest town. She saw new passengers in it every day. She was so obsessed by it that she wanted to get an opportunity to travel in it. The town was six miles away from the village and the fare was thirty rupees. She stopped the bus and had the joy ride. The conductor was really sweet to her and called her &#8216;madam&#8217;. She travelled back in the same bus.</p>
<p>Valli&#8217;s experience illustrates that if we have a dream and work towards it we will be successful. It only requires courage to face all risks and odds just like Valli did.<br />
OR<br />
Bholi was the youngest child of Ramlal, a revenue official in a village. Bholi was not very good looking and had pock marks all *, over her face. She also used to stammer badly. On the insistence of the Tehsildar, Ramlal was forced to put his daughter to study in the village school.Bholi was naturally very shy and would not open up.</p>
<p>However, a kind teacher helped Bholi to open up. She aksed her to be fearless and then she would be able to express hereself.<br />
It was the social attitude of the family that made Bholi and introvert. The family believed that she had no looks as there were pock marks all over her face. She could not speak till she was five and when she began to speak she stammered. As a result, she talked very little. The other, children in the family were good looking and healthy.</p>
<p>Children like Bholi need to be given confidence. They must be encouraged to open up by teachers and parents. The peer group should be encouraged to play with them. Kind words, love and sympathetic pat help them to regain confidence, unable then to compete with others, ultimately help them become socially acceptable.</p>
