Read and enjoy the following article.</p>
<p><strong>The Road to English</strong><br />
(Adapted from an article by Arishban Bagchi (Hindu college) [The Hindustan Times, 4 October 1996]</p>
<p>1. The great question, after you have failed to put yourself in an engineering or medical college in contemporary Indian society, is whether you’ll ever find a job.<br />
2. “Oh ! He showed such promise during his early days,” says the sister of the neighbour of your aunt in Timbuctoo. “Now look at my Bittoo,” she goes on. “In spite of being so brilliant and all, he could only barely manage a grade A+ at MIT, and then he only just managed a well-paid job. How difficult getting jobs must be.”<br />
3. The next line reads, “I wonder how your son will find a job, being a non-engineer, and that too in India.”<br />
4. Your father’s friend, a prosperous doctor, decides to come visiting. Quite predictably, his first question on seeing you is the inevitable, “Why in heaven’s name did you not qualify in the pre-medical test ?’ Followed by the equally inevitable, “Now what are you going to do ?”<br />
5. He raves on about his nephew who has just gone to the UK for his FRCS, and his daughter who has just completed her MBBS from AIIMS with top results, and what exciting prospects they have.<br />
6. Your father into whose eyes you haven’t dared to look for quite some time, speaks up. “I have lost all hope for him. However, educating him is my duty and I won’t shirk from it.”<br />
7. Someone speaks up. “Let him go to college to study Physics or Chemistry.” Everyone sits in silence. You cannot help feeling a little proud. At length, someone plucks up the courage: “It’s quite impossible to educate him any further. Youngsters these days never seem to listen to what we have to say.”<br />
8. “I will study English Literature,” you say, dropping a bombshell, fearless of the consequences. Amazingly, it works. The crowd hurries to disperse. You are so relieved to see their backs that you don’t care. Thankfully, your parents voice no objection, remembering, perhaps, that you did manage to score highly in English in your Board exams.<br />
9. So you finally take English literature as your subject of study.</p>
<p>A. 2.<br />
Work in pairs and list the speakers in the passage you have just read.<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The author (Arishban Bagchi)</li>
<li>Bittoo’s mother</li>
<li>A doctor</li>
<li>Bittoo’s father</li>
<li>Someone</li>
</ol>
<p>Still working in pairs, answer the following.</p>
<p>1. Did anyone actually say (or write) “Oh ! He showed such promise during his early days ?” (Yes/No) How can you tell ?</p>
<p>2. Is “Now look at my Bittoo”, said by the same person as the extract in 1 above ? (Yes/No) How do you know ?</p>
<p>3. In paragraph 4, who says “Now what are you going to do ?”<br />
What words help you to know ?</p>
<p>4. (i) ln paragraph 5, who is the speaker ? ____________<br />
Discues and work out what must have been his exact words. Then write them below. (To be discussed as desired)<br />
(ii) Underline the verb which tells you how the person must have said this.<br />
[Hint: Try to work out the meaning of this verb.]</p>
<p>5. How many of the nine paragraphs in the passage are reporting what someone has said ?</p>
<p>6. How many paragraphs include the exact words of the various speakers (direct speech)?</p>
<p>7. How many paragraphs have reported them ‘indirectly’ (indirect speech) ?</p>
<p>8. What is your conclusion about how writers report what someone says or has said in a newspaper article such as this ?</p>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p>1. Yes &#8230; It has been put in ‘inverted commas’.</p>
<p>2. Yes &#8230; ‘she goes on’ indicates it.</p>
<p>3. Father’s friend, a prosperous doctor<br />
The words which help us to know are : ‘his first question on seeing you &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..’ ‘followed by the equally inevitable, “________ ”</p>
<p>4. (i) Father’s friend, a prosperous doctor.<br />
“Look at my nephew who has just gone to the UK for his FRCS, and my daughter who has just completed her MBBS from AIIMS with top results. What exciting results they have !”<br />
(ii) The verb to be underlined is &#8211; ‘raves’<br />
Meaning = talks furiously and wildly</p>
<p>5. Six</p>
<p>6. Six</p>
<p>7. Three</p>
<p>8. In a newspaper article, the writers report some very important words in direct speech ie, as they are spoken. They report some in indirect speech adding the words from their own side to exactly report the underlining emotions, feelings, moods or manners.</p>
<p><strong>B. Reporting Verbs</strong></p>
<p>B. 1.<br />
A reporting verb is used in both direct and indirect (reported) speech. The reporting verb usually adds to the meaning of each sentence for instance, it may show the speaker’s MOOD (e.g. agreed), PURPOSE (e.g. asked), MANNER OF SPEAKER (e.g. shouted). An example is :</p>
<p>The tourist complained that the hotel was hot and noisy.</p>
<p>In this sentence, the reporting word ‘complained’ shows that the tourist was clearly unhappy about the arrangements.</p>
<p>Now work in groups of four. Read the following sentences carefully, and circle the reporting verbs. Then discuss and write the ways in which each reporting verb adds to the meaning of its arrangement.</p>
<ol>
<li>“When I was in school, I used to skip a few classes, especially Moral Science because of the bookish manner in which it was treated,” confessed the retired IAS Officer.</li>
<li>Saurav’s friends protested that he should have been included in the school badminton team, on the basis of his fine performance in the inter-house matches.</li>
<li>“Make a circle, make a circle !” Mira shouted, firmly pulling and pushing the children till a kind of vague circle was formed.</li>
<li>The music teacher warned the children against getting carried away and getting out of tune.</li>
<li>“Father, you must tell me what you meant exactly when you said that I was the same as every other teenager,” Varun insisted.</li>
<li>“Oh God ! She is coming again,” the children whispered to each other, when they saw Mrs Sharma striding towards their classroom for the third time that day.</li>
</ol>
<p>Answers:</p>
<ol>
<li>‘Confessed’ to be circled is the reporting verb used in the sentence. It reveals the mood of the speaker as he admits his weakness of skipping the class which was contrary to rules.</li>
<li>‘protested’ is to be circled in the reporting verb used in the sentence.<br />
The verb shows Saurav’s friends’ mood.</li>
<li>‘shouted’ is to be circled in the reporting verb in the sentence.<br />
‘Shouted’ shows Mira’s mood ie, irritable manner.</li>
<li>‘warned’ is to be circled in the reporting verb in the sentence.<br />
It reflects music teacher’s manner of speaking to the children ie, threatening manner.</li>
<li>‘insisted’ is to be circled in the reporting verb in the sentence.<br />
This verb shows Varan’s emphatic manner.</li>
<li>‘whispered’ is to be circled in the reporting verb in the sentence.<br />
This verb shows children’s tone and manner i.e. afraid and disliking.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now do the same with this situation. The following is a conversation that took place between Neeta and Shobhna (in the presence of Shohhna’s mother) last week.</p>
<p>Neeta : Can I borrow ₹25 ? I have lost all my money on the bus this morning.<br />
Shobhna : But you asked me for a loan last week as well, you haven’t repaid that yet. Sorry, But I can’t lend you any more.</p>
<p>Imagine it is now next week. Shobhna’s mother talks about it to her husband in her own words.</p>
<p>“Neeta came in last week and asked Shobhna if she could borrow twenty five rupees. She explained she had lost all her money on the bus that morning. Shobhna reminded Neeta that she had asked her for a loan the previous week as well, and still hadn’t repaid it. So she decided she couldn’t lend Neeta any more.<br />

<p>“Where do the two of you live ? You shouldn’t make such a noise in the street. If you do it again, I’ll have to complain to the police. So, be careful.”</p>
<p>Now think of a situation in which Mrs Bhattacharya has to report what she said to somebody but not exactly as she has said above (eg. to a neighbour.)<br />
Answer:<br />

<p>Work with your partner. Read the following. Decide on a likely situation in which what was said has been repeated. Then use your imagination and recreate the original (“direct”) speech.</p>
<p>Everyone at the hospital looked after me very well. As soon as I arrived, a nurse asked me how I felt. Then she asked me where I lived and whether she could contact my parents. I explained that you were out today, so she couldn’t contact you. After that she asked me how that accident had happened and I said I didn’t know.<br />

Situation. A boy telling his parents about an accident he had met that day, and how he was treated in the hospital.</p>
<p>Direct speech (in dialogue form)</p>
<p>Nurse : How do you feel?<br />
Boy : i am feeling nervous.<br />
Nurse : Where do you live ? Can I contact your parents ?<br />
Boy : i live in Model Town. You can’t contact my parents because they are out today.<br />

(d) He enquired if anyone was there.<br />
(e) She asked the receptionist if she would wait for the doctor or come again the following day.</p>
<p><strong>Points to Remember</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the direct question begins with a question word (when, where, who, how, why, what etc), the question word is repeated.</li>
<li>Tenses, pronouns, possessive adjectives and adverbs of time and place change as in statements.</li>
<li>The interrogative form of the verb changes to the affirmative form. The question mark (?) is therefore replaced by a full stop.
<ul>
<li>He said, “Where does she live ?”</li>
<li>He asked where she lived. .</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the introductory verb is ‘say’, it must be changed to a verb of inquiry, e.g. ask, inquire, wonder, want to know etc.</li>
<li>If the direct question does not have a question word, ‘if’ or ‘whether’ must be used.</li>
</ul>
<p>C.3.<br />

(d) “Why don’t you change into something more comfortable ?” he said to his guest.<br />
(e) “Go on, taste it”, said the cook to the guest.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will notice that direct commands, requests and advice are usually expressed by a suitable reporting verb in indirect speech (Refer Section B)</li>
</ul>
<p>Answers:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">(a) The General ordered to move the tanks to the battlefield immediately.<br />
(b) The instructor warned me not to drive too fast.<br />
(c) The agent told Anwar that if he were him, he would buy that property immediately.<br />
(d) He asked his guest why he didn’t change into something more comfortable.<br />

Look at the horoscope page from a newspaper. Find your zodiac sign. Imagine that you have come to the end of the week and nothing has happened, according to the horoscope. Write a letter of complaint to Madam Kiran. Report what Madam Kiran said would happen and then describe what actually happened. You may wish to write something similar to the letter in the example below.</p>
<p>Dear Madam Kiran,</p>
<p>I am writing to complain about your horoscope prediction for Virgo last week.</p>
<p>Firstly, you said that my relationships would be successful. In fact I had terrible squabbles with my mother and with no fewer than three different friends. You assured me that there would be a new admirer in my life who would make me feel confident about my future. Well, I have a new admirer but he is making my life a misery for me &#8230;&#8230;.<br />
Answer:<br />
I requested for his help in a friendly manner. But, he took it otherwise. This has added to my worry. Now I am in a fix what to do.</p>
<p>Secondly, you said that I would enjoy a new closeness or affinity with my husband. But he is still his old self. He is still indifferent and detached. I saw some silver lining in your prediction. But alas ! this has proved all wrong.</p>
<p>Thirdly, your prediction about the money matters proved totally wrong. On the contrary, I have been given an increment in my salary. Also, my husband has been promoted with a big raise in his salary.</p>
<p>I regret that your horoscope predictions for Virgo proved wrong in my case.</p>
<p>Yours<br />

<strong>‘Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow’</strong><br />
(By: Prerna XA)</p>
<p>Modern music and films have undergone a drastic change for the last two decades. New electronic instruments have brought a sea-change in rhyme, rhythm and pitch in the songs. But my father’s friend has declared that it is not music. It is simply an ear¬splitting noise which almost maddens a man. My father said, “It is no music at all” because of fast beats. I tried to assert that it was lively. I asked if they could imagine a party with the sort of music that they had about 20 years ago.</p>
<p>And films, the elderly people don’t like modern films. My aunt protested, “The films today are so cheap that no one can see them with one’s family.” At this my friend contended, “The actors and actresses today are so natural.” Another friend of mine added that he couldn’t stand the theatrical and ‘sing-song’ way in which actors delivered their lines in old films. Modern day films are more and convincing realistic. Another uncle of mine announced that the films in their time had meaningful stories. The argument came to an end with a concluding remark of my grandfather. He said, “Everyone thinks their time was the best.”</p>
<p>On the whole, trends change with the changing times. ‘Change is the Law of Nature.’</p>

Tiger numbers up, but habitat a worry</p>
<p>New Delhi : India’s tiger population has gone up. On Monday, environment minister Jairam ramesh will announce an increase of over 100 tigers across the country at a three-day international conference of experts on tigers.</p>
<p>But can India keep this rising numbers intact ? According to the government’s own study on tiger reserves, India cannot hold more than 1000 to 1200 tigers, with its forests having witnessed a degradation in the last two decades.</p>
<p>“Where is the habitat to keep so many tigers safe ?” asked Vivek Menon, chief executive officer of the Wildlife Trust of India. “Constant habitat destruction and illegal mining is causing wildlife stress,” said Dharmendra Kandhal, a wildlife biologist.</p>
