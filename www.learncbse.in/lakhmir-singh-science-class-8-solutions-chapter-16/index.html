<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 16 Very Short Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What is meant by &#8216;incident ray&#8217;?<br />
Answer:<br />
A ray of light that strikes a surface or falls on a surface before being reflected, transmitted or absorbed is known as incident ray.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What is meant by &#8216;reflected ray&#8217;?<br />
Answer:<br />
The light ray reflected by a surface, when an incident ray strikes the same surface is the reflected ray. The reflected ray corresponds to the incident ray always.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How many reflected rays can there be for a given single incident ray falling on a plane mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
For a single incident ray falling on a plane mirror, there is always a single reflected ray. The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection, this is by the law of reflection.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What do you understand by the term &#8216;point of incidence&#8217;?<br />
Answer:<br />
The point of incidence is the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What is &#8216;normal&#8217; in the reflection of light from a plane mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
Normal is an imaginary line perpendicular to the surface, in the reflection of light from a plane mirror.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Define the angle of incidence.<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle which incident ray makes with the perpendicular to the surface at the point of incidence.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Define the angle of reflection.<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle between the reflected ray and the line perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence is known as the angle of reflection.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
A ray of light is incident on a plane mirror at an angle of 30°. What is the angle of reflection?<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle of reflection will be 30 degree. This is by the law of reflection that angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
An incident ray makes an angle of 75° with the surface of a plane mirror. What will be the angle of reflection?<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle made by the normal will be 90 &#8211; 75 = 15. Angle made by normal is equal to angle of incidence. So i = 15 degree. And by the law of reflection which states that angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, the angle of reflection will be 15 degree.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
A ray of light is incident normally (perpendicularly) on a plane mirror. Where will this ray of light go after reflection from the mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
When a ray of light is incident normally (perpendicularly) on a plane mirror, the ray reflects and follows the same path.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
What is the angle of incidence when a ray of light is incident normally on a plane mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle of incidence when a ray of light is incident normally on a plane mirror is zero degree because the ray is incident normally.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
What is the angle of reflection when a ray of light is incident normally on a plane mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
The angle of reflection when a ray of light is incident normally on a plane mirror will be zero degree because the angle of incidence will be zero degree as the ray is incident normally. By law of reflection, angle of incidence = angle of reflection.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
What is the angle of incidence of a ray of light if the reflected ray is at an angle of 90° to the incident ray?<br />
Answer:<br />
the angle of incidence = angle of reflection.<br />
According to the question, given i + r = 90 degree<br />
i = r<br />
hence i + i = 90 degree<br />
2i = 90 degree.<br />
I = 45 degree.<br />
Therefore, the angle of incidence is 45 degree.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
Name the apparatus which is used to obtain a thin beam of light.<br />
Answer:<br />
The apparatus used to obtain a thin beam of light is known as Ray box. The rays are bright enough to be viewed easily. A ray box is a standard source of light used in optics experiments.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
What type of reflection of light takes place from:<br />
(a) a rough surface?<br />
(b) a smooth surface?<br />
Answer:<br />
a) Diffused reflection takes place from a rough surface. The reflected rays are not parallel in diffused reflection.<br />
b) Regular reflection takes place from a smooth surface. The reflected rays are parallel in regular reflection.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
Which type of reflection of light, regular reflection or diffuse reflection, leads to the formation of images?<br />
Answer:<br />
Regular reflection, wherein the reflected rays are parallel to each other, lead to the formation of images because all the rays get reflected in a particular direction. Regular reflection always occurs from a smooth surface.<br />
Diffused reflection does not lead to the formation of images because the rays do not reflect in one particular direction.</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
What type of reflection of light takes place from:<br />
(a) a cinema screen?<br />
(b) a plane mirror?<br />
Answer:<br />
a) Regular reflection occurs from a cinema screen because the surface of the screen is smooth.<br />
b) Regular reflection occurs from a plane mirror because the surface of a plane mirror is smoot/ even.</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />
If an object is placed at a distance of 7.5 cm from a plane mirror, how far would it be from its image?<br />
Answer:<br />
The object would be 15cm far away from its image if it is placed at a distance of 7.5cm from the plane mirror.</p>
<p>The object is at 7.5cm from the mirror, then the image of the object is 7.5cm on the other side of the mirror. Hence, the image is a total of 15cm from object (7.5cm to the mirror + 7.5cm to the image).</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
Is the image of an object in a plane mirror: virtual or real?<br />
Answer:<br />
The image of an object in a plane mirror is virtual. Virtual image cannot be projected onto the screen because it is not real.</p>
<p>A virtual image is a copy of the object, formed on the plane mirror. The light rays never come from the image. They appear to come from the object.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
Name the phenomenon responsible for the following effect:<br />
When we sit in front of a plane mirror and write with our right hand, it appears in the mirror that we are writing with the left hand.<br />
Answer:<br />
the phenomenon is known as Lateral inversion. The effect produced by a plane mirror in reversing the images from left to right and right to left while forming images is lateral inversion.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
Name a device which works on the reflection of reflected light.<br />
Answer:<br />
Periscope is one such device which works on the reflection of reflected light.</p>
<p>The light from the object falls on one mirror that is placed at 45o to the object and the light gets reflected. This reflected light in turn falls on another mirror and is again reflected until it reaches the eyepiece.</p>
<p>Question 22.<br />
How are the two plane mirrors in a periscope arranged:<br />
(a) with respect to one another?<br />
(b) with respect to sides of the tube?<br />
Answer:<br />
a) The 2 plane mirrors are parallel to one another.</p>
<p>b) The plane mirrors make an angle of 45 degrees with respect to the sides of the tube.</p>
<p>Question 23.<br />
What will be the number of images formed when an object is placed between two parallel plane mirrors facing each other?<br />
Answer:<br />
Infinite number of images are formed when an object is placed between two parallel plane mirrors facing each other. The object undergoes multiple reflection to produce image of the distant object. The distance between the mirror and the object is inconsiderable in formation of infinite images. No matter how much the distance be, number of images formed will be infinite.</p>

Answer:<br />
Cornea is the transparent front part of an eye. It covers the front portion of the eye.</p>
<p>Question 34.<br />
What is the name of a small opening in the iris of an eye?<br />
Answer:<br />
A small opening in the iris of an eye is known as pupil. Pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye.</p>
<p>Question 35.<br />
Which part of the eye gives it its distinctive color?<br />
Answer:<br />
Iris, the part of our eye, contains pigment and gives the eye its distinctive color. Iris also helps in controlling the size of the pupil by constricting and dilating it, thus reducing and increasing the amount of light entering the eye.</p>
<p>Question 36.<br />
Write the names of the main parts of the human eye.<br />
Answer:<br />
The main parts of the human eye are-</p>
<p>IRIS- The muscles of the iris dilate and constrict the pupil and thus increases and reduces the amount of light reaching the retina.</p>
<p>RETINA- Retina receives the light focused by the lens, the photoreceptors In the retina (rods and cones) convert this light into signals and the signals are then passed onto the brain for viewing.</p>
<p>LENS- Lens focuses the light rays passing through it onto the retina and thus creates a clear image of the objects in sight.</p>
<p>PUPIL- Pupil controls the amount of light that enters the eye. It is controlled by the iris.</p>
<p>CORNEA- Cornea acts as the outermost layer of the eye. It protects the eye with the eyelids.</p>
<p>CILIARY MUSCLES- The ciliary muscle fibers affect the zonular fibers in eye and thus change the lens shape and thus changes the converging power.</p>
<p>OPTIC NERVE- The optic nerve transmits signals from photoreceptors in the retina to the brain through electric impulses</p>
<p>Question 37.<br />
What happens to the size of the pupil of our eye in dim light?<br />
Answer:<br />
In dim light the size of the pupil of our eye becomes larger or dilates to increase the amount of light going inside the eye. This dilation in size is facilitated by the muscles of iris.</p>
<p>Question 38.<br />
What happens to the size of the pupil of our eye in bright light?<br />
Answer:<br />
In bright light the size of the pupil of our eye constricts and becomes small to reduce the amount of light going inside the eye. This reduction in size is facilitated by the muscles of iris.</p>
<p>Question 39.<br />

<p>Question 41.<br />
Suppose you are in a dark room. Can you see objects in the room? Can you see objects outside the room? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
The objects in a dark room cannot be seen because there is no light. We can only see something when a certain amount of light falls on it. The objects outside the room can only be seen if there is light outside the room.</p>
<p>Question 42.<br />
What makes things visible to us? Why cannot we see a book which is placed (a) behind a wooden screen, and (b) in a dark room?<br />
Answer:<br />
Light makes things visible to us. We see an object when light passing through it is reflected.<br />
We cannot see a book which is placed<br />
a- Behind a wooden screen because the wooden screen is opaque so it does not allow light to pass through it.</p>
<p>b- In a dark room because there is no light to be reflected by the book. Thus, due to no reflection, the book is not visible.</p>
<p>Question 43.<br />
We can see the sun because it is glowing. How are we able to see the moon?<br />
Answer:<br />
We are able to see the moon because the light of sun falls on moon and is reflected onto the earth. Hence, we are able to see the moon.</p>
<p>Question 44.<br />
Name the two types of reflection of light. Which type of reflection makes us see an object from all directions?<br />
Answer:<br />
The two types of reflection of light are Regular reflection of light and Diffused reflection of light.</p>
<p>Regular reflection of light makes us see an object from all directions as the reflected rays are all parallel and in a particular direction so the image of the object can be viewed from all directions. In diffused reflection of light the reflected rays are neither parallel nor in a specific direction so the image of the object isn’t visible from any direction.</p>
<p>Question 45.<br />
A wall reflects light and a mirror also reflects light. What difference is there in the way they reflect light?<br />
Answer:<br />
Reflection of light from a wall is diffused reflection because the surface of the wall is uneven so the light is reflected in different directions and also the reflected rays are not parallel</p>
<p>Reflection of light from a mirror is regular reflection because the surface of mirror is an even surface which is polished. The light gets reflected from the mirror surface in one particular direction and the reflected rays are all parallel.</p>
<p>Question 46.<br />
Explain why, a book lying on a table in a room can be seen from all the parts of the room.<br />

<p>Question 60.<br />
How does eye adjust itself to deal with light of varying intensity?<br />
Answer:<br />
The iris adjusts the size of pupil according to the light of varying intensity.</p>
<p>When the amount of light is very high, the iris contracts the pupil and reduces the amount of light entering the eye. Whereas, when the amount of light is less, the iris expands the pupil so that more light can enter the eye and things can be viewed clearly.</p>
<p>Question 61.<br />
Explain why, we cannot see our surroundings clearly when we enter a darkened cinema hall from bright sunshine but our vision improves after some time.<br />
Answer:<br />
In bright sunshine the size of the pupil of the eye is very small so when we enter a darkened cinema hall from bright sunshine very little amount of light enters the eye. The vision improves at some time later because the pupil dilates and more amount of light enters the eye easily.</p>
<p>Question 62.<br />
How does the eye-lens differ from the ordinary convex lens made of glass?<br />

<p>(b) Rods are sensitive to dim light. Rod shaped cells present in the retina are sensitive to dim light. They are most important for vision in dim light</p>
<p>(c) Cones are the cells of retina that produce color sensation. These photoreceptor cells are responsible for color vision.</p>
<p>Question 65.<br />
What are rods and cones in the retina of an eye?<br />
Answer:<br />
Rods are rod shaped cells present in the retina are sensitive to dim light. They are most important for vision in dim light.</p>
<p>Cones are cone shaped cells present in the retina are sensitive to bright light. These photoreceptor cells are responsible for color vision.</p>
<p>Question 66.<br />
Name any one defect of the eye. How is it corrected?<br />
Answer:<br />
Myopia (nearsightedness) is the defect of vision wherein a person is unable to see the distant objects clearly as the light is unable to focus on the retina and thus distant objects appear to be blurred. The problem of nearsightedness is that the light is focused in front of the retina</p>
<p>Myopia is corrected by wearing glasses or contact lenses. A concave lens(diverging lens) with a minus power is used in the glass, which moves the image back to retina and thus clears the image. The diverging lens will diverge the light before it reaches the retina. The light will then be converged by cornea and lens thus producing an image on the retina.</p>
<p>Question 67.<br />
What is cataract? How can the vision of a person having cataract be restored?<br />
Answer:<br />
Cataract is the clouding of the lens of human eye, that lies behind the iris and pupil. It leaves to a blurred vision or decrease in vision.</p>
<p>The lens that has becomes cloudy is replaced by an artificial lens to restore the normal and clear vision.</p>
<p>Question 68.<br />
What is meant by &#8216;persistence of vision&#8217;?<br />
Answer:<br />
Persistence of Vision- The property of this phenomenon is that the image formed on the retina of the eye persists for about 1/16th of a second, hence if 16 frames are shown on a screen in succession, they are viewed by the retina as an ongoing action.</p>
<p>Question 69.<br />

Name any five food items (including two fruits) which are rich in vitamin A.<br />
Answer:<br />
5 food items rich in vitamin A are- fish, sweet potatoes, carrots, banana, pink grapefruit, apricots.</p>
<p>Question 72.<br />
Explain why, too little or too much light, both are bad for eyes.<br />
Answer:<br />
In the presence of little light the iris has to dilate pupil to facilitate entry of more and more light to view things, which leads to strain on the eyes and causes headaches.<br />
In case of too much light, the retina may get injured and damaged thus impairing vision.</p>
<p>Question 73.<br />
Explain why, an owl can see well in the night (but not during the day) whereas an eagle can see well during day (but not at night).<br />
Answer:<br />
An owl can see well in the night but not during the day because owl is a night bird and night birds have fewer cones and more rods in the retina. Since rods function in less amount of light so an owl can see well in the night. To see well during the day, cones are required which are not present in adequate amount in an owl’s retina.</p>
<p>An eagle can see well during the day but not during the night because eagle has more cones and lesser rods in the retina. Cones function in good amount of light so an eagle can see well during the day. To see well during the night, rods are required which are not present in adequate amount in a n eagle’s retina.</p>
<p>Question 74 A.<br />
What is &#8216;blind spot&#8217; in the eye?<br />
Answer:<br />
Blind spot is the point in human eye where the image is not visible. This is because there are no photoreceptors, i.e., rods and cones present in the optical disk.</p>
<p>Question 74 B.<br />
What is night blindness? What causes night blindness?<br />
Answer:<br />
Night blindness is the inability to see properly at night or in poor light. In scientific terms, it is called as &#8220;nyctalopia&#8221;.<br />
The following factors cause night blindness:</p>
<ol>
<li>The deficiency of Vitamin A (retinol) in the diet of a person for a considerable time can lead to the disease called night blindness.</li>
<li>The disorder in which the rod cells in the retina gradually lose their ability to respond to the light.</li>
<li>It can also happen due to cataract, or clouding of the eye’s lens.</li>
<li>Usher syndrome can also cause night blindness, which is a genetic condition that affects both hearing and vision.</li>
<li>Nearsightedness or blurred vision can also cause night blindness.</li>
</ol>

(a) Iris<br />
(b) Eye-lens<br />
(c) Ciliary muscles<br />
(d) Retina<br />
(e) Optic nerve<br />
Answer:<br />
Functions of parts-<br />
IRIS- The muscles of the iris dilate and constrict the pupil and thus increases and reduces the amount of light reaching the retina.</p>
<p>EYE-LENS- Lens focuses the light rays passing through it onto the retina and thus creates a clear image of the objects in sight.</p>
<p>CILIARY MUSCLES- The ciliary muscle fibers affect the zonular fibers in eye and thus change the lens shape and thus changes the converging power.</p>
<p>RETINA- Retina receives the light focused by the lens, the photoreceptors In the retina (rods and cones) convert this light into signals and the signals are then passed onto the brain for viewing.</p>
<p>OPTIC NERVE- The optic nerve transmits signals from photoreceptors in the retina to the brain through electric impulses.</p>

<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 16 Questions Based on High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)</h3>
<p>Question 101.<br />
A man stands 10 m in front of a large plane mirror. How far must he walk before he is 5 m away from his image?<br />
Answer:<br />
The object distance is equal to image distance in a plane mirror.<br />
For the distance of man from his image to be 5m<br />
The distance of man from mirror + distance of image from the mirror = 5m<br />
Since object distance = image distance<br />
Therefore, 2*distance of man from the mirror = 5m<br />
Distance of man from the mirror = 5/2 = 2.5m<br />
The man is 10m from the mirror at the starting, so he will have to walk 10 – 2.5 = 7.5m towards the mirror for being 5m away from his image.</p>
<p>Question 102.<br />
A ray of light strikes a plane mirror XY at an angle of incidence of 65°, is reflected from this plane mirror and then strikes a second plane mirror YZ placed at right angles to the first mirror. What is the angle of reflection for the mirror YZ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The mirrors XY and YZ are at right angles, i.e., perpendicular. When a ray of light strikes the XY mirror with 65 degree angle, the incident angle will be 90 &#8211; 65 = 25 degree on the YZ mirror. Since angle of incidence = angle of reflection, the angle of reflection for YZ mirror will be 25 degrees.</p>
<p>Question 103.<br />
The eye of a person exhibits a phenomenon X due to which it can see the image of an object for a short duration of Y even after the object has disappeared from his view. It is due to the phenomenon X that we are able to see moving Z on a television screen. What are X, Y and Z?<br />
Answer:<br />
The phenomenon X is persistence of vision. The property of this phenomenon is that the image formed on the retina of the eye persists for about 1/16th of a second, hence if 16 frames are shown on a screen in succession, they are viewed by the retina as an ongoing action.<br />
Short duration of Y is 1/16 seconds.<br />
Z is pictures. Due to the phenomenon of persistence of vision, we are able to see moving pictures on a television or a cinema screen.</p>
<p>Question 104.<br />
Man A has a defect of vision due to which he cannot see the nearby objects clearly (though he can see the distant objects clearly). On the other hand, man B has a defect of vision due to which he cannot see the distant object clearly (though he can see the nearby objects clearly). The defect in man A can be corrected by using spectacles containing lenses C whereas the defect in man B can be corrected by using spectacles containing lenses D.<br />
(a) Name the defect of vision in man (i) A, and (ii) B.<br />
(b) What type of lenses are (i) C, and (ii) D?<br />
Answer:<br />
a) i-Man A suffers from hypermetropia wherein the image of a nearby object is formed behind the retina so the person has a blurred vision while looking at nearby objects.</p>
<p>ii- Man B suffers from myopia wherein Light from a distant object forms an image before it reaches the retina so the person can see the nearby objects clearly but not the distant objects.</p>
<p>b) C are Convex lens. these lenses are placed in front of a hyper-metropic eye which moves the image forward and focuses directly onto the retina which clears the vision of a nearby object.</p>
<p>D are concave lenses. These lenses are placed in front of a myopic eye which moves the image back to the retina and clarifies the image of a distant object.</p>
<p>Question 105.<br />
A student makes a device P by using three long and narrow strips of plane mirrors inclined at 60° to one another which enables him to see beautiful patterns made by pieces of coloured glass bangles. On the other hand, another student makes a device Q by using two plane mirrors arranged parallel to each other which helps him to see a football match clearly even when some very tall persons are sitting in front of him in the ground. What are P and Q?<br />
Answer:<br />
Device P is a Kaleidoscope which consists of 3 plain mirror strips are arranged inside a tube (cylinder) with colored glass pieces at one end and a glass to view on the other.</p>
<p>The device Q is a Periscope. A periscope is a device that reflects the reflected ray again. It consists of a tube attached to a set of 2 mirrors. A periscope is used to see over, through or around any object. So, the student is able to see a football match clearly even when some very tall persons are sitting in front of him in the ground because the periscope helps him in seeing over, through and around the tall persons sitting in front of him in the ground.</p>
