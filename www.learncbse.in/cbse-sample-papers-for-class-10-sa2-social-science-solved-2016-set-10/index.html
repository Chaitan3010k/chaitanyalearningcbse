Or<br />
The Vietminh was able to drive the Japanese out of Hanoi in September 1945 and a set up a democratic republic with Ho Chi Minh as President.<br />
(i)The republic however had to face difficulties. The French who left during the Second World War wanted to regain control after the war; they set up a puppet government under Bao Dai and drove the Vietminh out.

<p><strong>13.Why are fertilizer industries concentrated around the production of nitrogenous fertilizers. Give three reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>The fertiliser industry is centred around the production of nitrogenous fertilizers, phosphate and complex fertilizers which have a combination of Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash. India is the third largest producer of nitrogenous fertilisers. In case of Potash, India is entirely dependent on imports as we are deficient in commercially usable potash or potassium compounds in any form. Today India has 57 fertilizer units which have expanded to several parts of the country. At present there are 10 public sector plants and one cooperative sector plant at Hazira in Gujarat under the Fertilizer Corporation of India. Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Kerala contribute to half of the fertilizer production.</p>

(ii)National Highways<br />
(iii)State Highways<br />
(iv)Other roads<br />
(v)District roads<br />
(vi)Border roads<br />

(iv)District roads are constructed and maintained by the Zila Parishad.<br />
(v)Other roads include the rural roads which link rural areas and villages and towns.<br />
(vi)Border roads are constructed and maintained by the Border Roads Organisation.<br />
These roads are important for the defence of our country.<br />
Role of National Highway Authority of India. This organisation is responsible for the construction of Super Highways in India. Their major objective is to reduce time and distance between the mega cities of India.</p>
<p><strong>15.How do state or regional political parties contribute in strengthening federalism and democracy in India? Explain. Why can&#8217;t modern democracies exist without political parties? Explain any three reasons.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.As India is a federal state, so more regional parties mean, more influence of state parties in national politics.</p>
<ul>
<li>Now, regional parties have a say in political policies as they win elections in their states.</li>
<li>In the present political scenario no single National party has been able to form a government on its own strength since 1996.</li>
<li>They had to form alliances with the regional parties to form a coalition government at the centre. This has broadened the concept of popular participation and strengthened the federation and democracy in our country.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>16.What must not take place in a democracy, if it is a good democracy?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>Political parties are necessary for democracy because</p>
<ul>
<li>they unite and aggregate like-minded people from diverse backgrounds, religions, etc., to form a wide coalition of people and give unity in diversity.</li>
<li>The political parties which win a majority form the government and undertake socio-economic and cultural reforms to try and establish a welfare state. The parties, which get a minority of votes, form the opposition and check the government through different means.</li>
<li>parties provide an important two-way link between the government and the people. In this way they keep the government in close touch with the people.</li>
<li>Besides, political parties impart political education to the people by popularising their manifesto and through other means like meetings, posters, demonstrations, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these show that political parties are necessary and modern democracies cannot exist without political parties.</p>
<p><strong>17.What values do you learn from this thought?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.(a) Democracy is the kind but not the ideal form of government. There are some drawbacks which should not take place in a democracy if it is a good democracy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absence of Morality: Democracy is all about political competition and power play. There is no scope for morality. Hence, &#8220;morality&#8221; should be made one of the basic principles of democracy.</li>
<li>Chances of Defection: Normally, leaders keep changing in a democracy. This leads to instability. But this attitude of leaders should be checked under the &#8220;anti-defection law&#8221;</li>
<li>Democracy Leads to Corruption: Democracy leads to corruption for it is based on electoral competition. Democracy must follow the principle of electoral coordination. All elected leaders do not know what&#8217;s best in interest of the people. It often leads to bad decisions. Hence, some parametres of moral and intellectual nature should be introduced.</li>
<li>Delay in Decision Making: Commonly in a democracy so many people have to be consulted that it leads to delays. Therefore, only a group of selected leaders must be consulted for the quick and meaningful decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the basis of the above arguments we can clearly say that democracy is not a magical solution to all the problems. It cannot end poverty in our country and in other parts of the world.<br />
Therefore, some drawbacks must be avoided to make democracy a better form of government.<br />
(b) (i) Judgemental value<br />
(ii)Legal values<br />
(iii)Togetherness</p>
<p><strong>18.What steps have been taken by the government to improve credit facilities in the rural areas?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Following steps have been taken by the government to improve credit facilities in the rural areas:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More and more branches have been set up in the rural areas so that the rural folk can make use of them.</li>
<li>Credit taking process has been made easier and hassle free.</li>
<li>Micro credit schemes have been launched so that the poor can avail credit at very low interest rates and repay as per their convenience.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>19.Why are foreign companies outsourcing certain part of their business to countries like India?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Foreign companies are outsourcing certain part of their business in developing countries like India because of the following reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Developing countries have a sufficient availability of a wide variety of skilled labour.</li>
<li>The labour cost is less as compared to the developed countries</li>
<li>The quality of services performed is much better.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>20.Why is the consumer redressal process becoming a burden?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Because of the following reasons the consumer redressal is becoming burdensome:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Many a times lawyers are required to be engaged.</li>
<li>The cases require time for filing and attending the proceedings.</li>
<li>In most of the cases the cash memos, receipts, are not issued and so it is not easy to gather evidences.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The existing laws are not clear on the issue of compensation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>21.How was the formation of the nation-state the result of a long drawn out process in Britain? Explain.</strong><br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
<strong>How did nationalism in Vietnam emerge through the efforts of different sections of the society to fight against the French? Explain.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>(i) Prior to 18th century there was no British nation. People who inhabited the British island were identified by<br />
the ethnic group to which they belonged such as English, Welsh, Scots or Irish and had their cultural and political traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Out of these the English nation steadily grew in importance, wealth and power and was able to extend its influence over other nations of the island.</li>
<li>The English Parliament, which had seized power from monarchy in 1688 was the instrument through which a nation-state, with England at the centre, came to be forged.</li>
<li>The Act of Union (1707) between England and Scotland resulted in the formation of Great Britain.</li>
<li>In effect it meant that Scotland came under the influence of England. The British Parliament from now was dominated by the English members, (overall assessment)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or<br />
<strong>Nationalism in Vietnam emerged through the efforts of different sections of the society to fight against the French due to following reasons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>From the 18th century many religious movements were hostile to western presence. An early movement against French control and the spread of Christianity was the Scholars Revolt of 1868, led by officials of the imperial court.</li>
<li>In the late 19th century, resistance to French domination was led by Phan Boi Chau (1867-1940), an eminent nationalist. He became a major figure in anti-colonial resistance and formed the revolutionary society.</li>
<li>Another nationalist Phan Chi Trinh differed from Phan Boi Chau. Phan Chi Trinh was intensely hostile to monarchy and was opposed to the idea of resisting the French. His desire was to establish a monarchy on democratic ideals of the west.</li>
<li>In the first decade of 20th century in 1907-08 a &#8216;Go East Movement&#8217; became popular by nearly 300 students who went to Japan for higher education. Their main objective was to overthrow the puppet emperor and reestablish the Nguyen dynasty who were opposed to the French.</li>
<li>They wanted to secure Japanese help and set up a branch of the Restoration Society in Tokyo.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>22.How did the First World War help in the growth of nationalism in India?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>The First World War played an important role in strengthening national movement in India.<br />
The war created a new economic and political situation. It led to an increase in expenditure which was met by the additional taxes on Indian people.<br />
The War led to a price rise—leading to extreme hardships for the common people.<br />
Villages were called upon to supply soldiers and this forced recruitment in rural areas, causing widespread anger.<br />
Acute shortage of food accompanied by influenza epidemic led to famine and misery. The Indians began to realise, that they were unnecessarily drawn in a war which was for British imperialist interest. This feeling united the Indians against the British who began to demand reforms.<br />
Fortunately during the period of war, Gandhiji returned to India from South Africa and gave the leadership to people by organising Satyagraha which was the mass struggle against foreign authorities.</p>
<p><strong>23.&#8217;The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries&#8217;. Give five reasons to support your answer.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>The economic strength of a country is measured by the development of manufacturing industries.</p>
<ul>
<li>All the developed countries such as Japan, U.S.A., Germany, France are highly industrialised.</li>
<li>Industries create a variety of jobs and thus reduce the dependence of people on agriculture and contribute to modernisation of our agriculture.</li>
<li>Industrial development has contributed to the eradication of poverty and unemployment.</li>
<li>Export of manufactured goods add value to the economy.</li>
<li>Industries utilise primary materials and convert them into articles of utility, thus adding value to raw materials.</li>
<li>Industries help in improving the public services like transport, communication, health, education, banking,administration, etc. They help in raising the standard of living of the people.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>24.The &#8216;International trade of a country is considered as its economic barometer&#8217;. Elaborate the statement giving five examples.                                             </strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>No country in the world is self-sufficient in all its needs. Goods produced by one country are required by the other and vice versa. Hence differences in resources, needs and development among nations create conditions for International trade between them.<br />
It helps in exchange of surplus goods with those of deficit countries through foreign trade.<br />
Foreign trade has helped India to improve its productivity of manufactured goods. International trade contributes to India&#8217;s economic growth, raising income levels of people. Thus, increasing the foreign exchange reserves.<br />
International trade helps India to import advanced technology of other countries to improve its own production. Thus prosperity of a country depends on the advancement of International trade and hence is called the &#8220;economic barometer&#8221; of a nation.</p>
<p><strong>25.Describe the five main features of the popular mass struggle for restoring democracy in Nepal.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>Nepal witnessed an extraordinary popular mass struggle in April 2006 for restoring democracy in Nepal.<br />
<strong>Main features:</strong><br />
(i)In the very first, the mass struggle for democracy was launched by a Seven-Party Alliance i.e., SPA. Later the Maoists and other insurgent groups joined hands.<br />
(ii)The struggle/movement put forward three demands:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restoration of Parliament.</li>
<li>Transfer of power to an all party government.</li>
<li>Constitution of a new Constituent Assembly.</li>
</ul>
<p>(iii)Then, there was a call for an indefinite strike by the SPA. The alliance had some members of the Parliament and of some other big parties.<br />
(iv)The Monarchy of Nepal responded by adopting various repressive measures, but the movement could not be suppressed. Here, SPA was not the only organisation supporting the mass upsurge-Nepalese Communist Party (Maoist) was also a part of it. It did not believe in Parliamentary Democracy. It had opposed the Nepali government and controlled large parts of Nepal.<br />
(v)Ultimately, the king was forced to concede all the demands and an interim government was immediately formed.</p>
<p><strong>26.Why is there a lack of internal democracy within the political parties in India? Explain with examples</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.It is a dilemma that while the political parties are seen as an effective instrument of democratic decentralisations, there is no democracy within the parties. There are various reasons for lack of democracy like;</p>
<ul>
<li>Concentration of power in one or a few leaders at the top.</li>
<li>Details of membership are not registered in the parties.</li>
<li>There are no proper organisational meetings among the political parties and internal elections for membership are never held regularly.</li>
<li>Most of the political parties are lacking means of communication, as ordinary members of the party do not get sufficient information.</li>
<li>Leaders of the party have unanimous power of decision making in the name of the party.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus, all these indicate that in most of the political parties, the personal loyalty to the leaders is more important than the loyalty to the principle and policies of the party.</p>
<p><strong>27.What is a Reserve Bank? Mention its functions.</strong><br />
