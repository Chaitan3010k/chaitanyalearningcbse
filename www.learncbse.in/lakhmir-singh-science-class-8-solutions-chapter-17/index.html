<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 17 Very Short Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Name any two celestial objects which we can see easily in the night sky.<br />
Answer:<br />
Moon and the stars are the celestial objects which we can see easily in the night sky.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Name the star (after the Sun) which is closest to the Earth.<br />
Answer:<br />
Alpha Centauri is the star which is closest to the Earth after the Sun. It is at a distance of about 40,000,000,000,000 km from the Earth.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Name the star which remains fixed at the same place in the sky in the North.<br />
Answer:<br />
The pole star is the star which remains fixed at the same place in the sky in the North.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Name the unit which is used to express distances between the various celestial bodies (like stars and planets).<br />
Answer:<br />
Light year is the unit used to express distance between the various celestial bodies. Light year is the distance travelled by light in one year. The speed of light is 300,000 km per second. For example, the Sun is nearly 150,000,000 Km i.e. 150 million Km away from the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth may be said to be about 8 light minutes.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Why is the distance between stars and planets expressed in light years?<br />
Answer:<br />
The distance between the Earth and stars and the distance between the stars is very large. The stars are millions of times farther away than the Sun. the Sun is nearly 150,000,000 Km i.e. 150 million Km away from the Earth. It is inconvenient to express these distances in kilometres. Therefore, these large distances are expressed in light years. For example, the distance of the Sun from the Earth may be said to be about 8 light minutes.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What do you understand by the statement that a star is 8 light years away from the Earth?<br />
Answer:<br />
The distance between the Earth and stars and the distance between the stars is very large. It is inconvenient to express these distances in kilometres. Therefore, these large distances are expressed in light years.</p>
<p>1 light year= 9.46 × 10<sup>12</sup> Km. Now, a star is 8 light years away from the Earth. It means the distance between the star and the Earth is equal to the distance travelled by light in eight years.</p>
<p>Therefore, the star is located 8 × 9.46 × 10<sup>12</sup> Km = 75.68 × 10<sup>12</sup> Km away from the Earth.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Name the constellation which reminds us of a large ladle or a question mark in the night sky.<br />
Answer:<br />
Ursa Major is the constellation which reminds us of a large ladle or a question mark in the night sky. It is also known as the Big Dipper, the Great Bear or the Saptarshi. There are seven prominent stars in this constellation. It appears like a big ladle or a question mark. There are three stars in the handle of the ladle and four in its bowl.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
In which season of the year is the constellation Orion visible in the sky?<br />
Answer:<br />
The constellation Orion is visible during winter in the late evenings. It also has seven or eight bright stars. It is also called the Hunter. The three middle stars represent the belt of the hunter. The four bright stars appear to be arranged in the form of a quadrilateral.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
In which season of the year is the constellation Ursa Major visible in the sky?<br />
Answer:<br />
Ursa Major can be seen during summer time in the early part of the night. It has seven prominent stars.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Give two other names of Ursa Major constellation.<br />
Answer:<br />
Ursa Major constellation is also known as the Big Dipper, the Great Bear or the Saptarshi. There are seven prominent stars in this constellation. It appears like a big ladle or a question mark.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
In which season of the year are the following constellations visible in the night sky?<br />
(a) Cassiopeia<br />
(b) Leo Major<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Cassiopeia is another prominent constellation in the northern sky. It is visible during winter in the early part of the night. It looks like a distorted letter W or M.</p>
<p>(b) Leo Major is visible in the northern hemisphere around the spring. It is easily identifiable through may. Its brightest star is Regulus. Its most prominent pattern of stars is a backwards question mark called the Sickle. You can use the Pointer stars of the Big Dipper to find Leo Major.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
Name the biggest planet of the Solar System.<br />
Answer:<br />
Jupiter is the biggest planet of the Solar system. It is so large that about 1300 earths can be placed inside this giant planet.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
Name the smallest planet of the Solar System.<br />
Answer:<br />
Mercury is the smallest planet of the Solar system. It is nearest to the Sun.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
Which force keeps the members of the Solar System bound to the Sun?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Sun and the celestial bodies which revolve around it form the solar system. It consists of large number of bodies such as planets, comets, asteroids and meteors. The Gravitational force keeps the members of the Solar System bound to the Sun.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />

The stars, the planets, the moon and many other objects in the sky are called celestial objects. The moon is the brightest object in the night sky. Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. Our sun is also a star. Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth. The Sun and the celestial bodies which revolve around it form the solar system. These celestial bodies include the planets, comets, asteroids and meteors.</p>
<p>Question 47.<br />
What is a star? Name the star nearest to the Earth.<br />
Answer:<br />
Stars are celestial bodies that emit light of their own. Our sun is also a star. It is convenient to express distances of stars in light years. Stars appear to move from east to west. The pole star appears to be stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth. Some groups of stars appear to form recognizable groups known as constellation. The Sun is the star nearest to the Earth. It is the source of almost all energy on the Earth. The Sun is the main source of heat and light for all the planets.</p>
<p>Question 48.<br />
Why does Pole Star appear to be stationary in the sky?<br />
Answer:<br />
The pole star appears to be stationary from the Earth, because it is situated close to the direction of the axis of rotation of the Earth. The Pole Star is not visible from the southern hemisphere. Some of the northern constellations like Ursa Major may also not be visible from some points in the southern hemisphere.</p>
<p>Question 49.<br />

<p>Question 53.<br />
What are planets? How many planets are there in the Solar System?<br />
Answer:<br />
Planets are the members of the Solar System. They look like stars but they do not have light of their own. They reflect the sunlight that fall on them. They keep changing their positions with respect to the stars. A planet revolves around the Sun in a definite path. This path is called an orbit. The time taken by a planet to complete one revolution is called its period of revolution. As the distance of the planet increases from the Sun, the period of revolution increases. A planet also rotates on its axis besides revolving around the Sun. The time taken by the planet to complete one rotation is called its period of rotation. Some planets have moons or satellites revolving around them.</p>
<p>Question 54.<br />
Name all the planets of the Solar System in the order of their increasing distances from the Sun.<br />

Meteorites are the large meteors which can reach the Earth before they evaporate completely. Meteorites help scientists in investigating the nature of the material from which the solar system was formed.</p>
<p>Question 74.<br />
What is the difference between a meteor and a meteorite?<br />
Answer:<br />
Meteor is seen as a bright streak of light coming down the night sky. A meteor is usually a small object that occasionally enters the Earth’s atmosphere with very high speed. The friction due to the atmosphere heats it up and it glows and evaporates quickly. As a result, the bright streak lasts for a very short time. These are commonly known as shooting stars. Meteorites are the large meteors which can reach the Earth before they evaporate completely. Meteorites help scientists in investigating the nature of the material from which the solar system was formed.</p>

<p>Question 80 A.<br />
What is the difference between a full Moon and a new Moon? After how many days a full Moon changes into a new Moon?<br />
Answer:<br />
There is a change in the shape of moon every day. There are days when the shape of moon appears perfectly round. Also, there are days when the moon cannot be seen at all even if the sky is clear. The day on which the whole disc of the moon is visible is called the full Moon day. Every night, the size of the bright part of the moon appears to become thinner and thinner. On the fifteenth day, the moon is not visible. This day is called the new Moon day. The next day, only a small portion of the moon appears in the sky. This is known as the crescent moon. Then again, the moon grows larger every day. On the fifteenth day once again we get a full view of the moon. After fifteen days, the full moon changes into a new Moon.</p>
<p>Question 80 B.<br />
What is meant by the phases of the Moon? What causes the phases of the Moon?<br />
Answer:<br />
The different shapes of the bright part of the moon as seen during a month are called the phases of the moon. Moon is the natural satellite of the Earth. It revolves around the Earth. It completes one rotation on its axis as it completes one revolution around the Earth. The moon does not have light of its own. We are able to see the moon because the sunlight falling on its surface gets reflected towards us. We, therefore, see only that part of the moon, from which the light of the Sun is reflected towards us. The size of the illuminated part of the moon visible from the Earth increases each day after the new moon day. After the full moon day, the sunlit part of the moon visible from the Earth decreases in size every day. This process leads to the phases of the Moon.</p>
