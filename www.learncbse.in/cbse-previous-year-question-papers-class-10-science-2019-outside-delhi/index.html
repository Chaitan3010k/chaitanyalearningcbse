<h3>CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2019 Outside Delhi Set I</h3>
<p><strong>Section &#8211; A</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Name two industries based on forest produce. [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
Timber industries and paper manufacturing industries are based on forest produce.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why are the heating elements of electric toasters and electric irons made of an alloy rather than a pure metal? [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
The resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals. Alloys do not oxidise (bum) readily at higher temperatures. Therefore, conductors of electric heating devices, such as toasters and electric irons, are made up of an alloy rather than pure metal.</p>
<p><strong>Section &#8211; B</strong></p>
<p>Question 3.<br />

<p>Question 4.<br />
Given reasons:<br />
(a) Platinum, gold and silver are used to make jewellery.<br />
(b) Metals like sodium and potassium are stored under oil.<br />
OR<br />
Silver articles become black when kept in open for some time, whereas copper vessels lose their shiny brown surfaces and gain a green coat when kept in open. Name the substances present in air with which these metals react and write the name of the products formed. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Platinum, gold and silver are used to make jewellery because of its bright and shiny surface. This property is called metallic lustre.<br />
(b) Metals like sodium and potassium are stored under oil because they are very reactive in nature, they react with oxygen present in air. Thus to prevent their oxidation they are kept in the oil.<br />
OR<br />
Silver articles become black when kept in open for some time, whereas copper vessel lose their shiny brown surfaces and gain a green coat when kept in open because silver articles reacts with sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide present in the air to form silver sulphide (Ag<sub>2</sub>S) whereas copper reacts slowly with CO<sub>2</sub> and water present in the air to form green coating of mixture of copper carbonate and copper hydroxide.</p>

<p>Question 17.<br />
(a) Why is the use of iodised salt advisable? Name the disease caused due to deficiency of iodine in our diet and state its one symptom.<br />
(b) How do nerve impulses travel in the body? Explain.<br />
OR<br />
What is hydrotropism? Design an experiment to demonstrate this phenomenon. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Iodised salt is advisable because iodine is necessary for the formation of thyroxine hormone by the thyroid gland. Goitre is the disease caused due to its deficiency.<br />
Symptom: The neck of the person appears to be swollen due to the enlargement of thyroid gland.</p>
<p>(b) Two neurons are not joined to one another completely. There is a small gap between a pair of neuron. This gap is called synapse. The nerve impulse are carried out to this gap by the help of neurotransmitter (chemical substance). The conduction of nerve impulse through the synapse takes place in the form of electrical nerve impulse. When a stimulus acts on the receptor, an electrical impulse is produced with the help of chemical reaction. This electrical impulse passes through the synapse and then to the other neuron. Thus, in this way nerve impulses travel in the body.<br />
OR<br />
The movement of root of plants towards water is called hydrotropism.<br />
Take two glass troughs A and B fill each one of them two-thirds with soil. In trough A plant a tiny seedling figure (a). In trough B plant a similar seedling and also place a small &#8216;clay pot&#8217; inside the soil figure (b). Water the soil in trough A daily and uniformly. Do not water the soil in trough B but put some water in the clay pot buried in the soil. Leave both the troughs for a few days.<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48372117421_6e7fe8a7f7_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2019 Outside Delhi Set I Q17" width="357" height="356" /><br />
Now, dig up the seedlings carefully from both the trough without damaging their roots. We will find that the root of seedling in trough A is straight. On the other hand, the root of seedling in trough B is found to be bent to the right side (towards the clay pot containing water) figure (b). This can be explained as follows.</p>
<p>In trough A, the root of seedling gets water from both sides (because the soil is watered uniformly) in trough B, the roots gets water oozing out from the clay pot which is kept on the right side. So, the root of seedling in trough B grows and bends towards the source of water to the right side. The experiment shows that the root of a plant grows towards water. In other words, the root of a plant is positively hydrotropic.</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />
(a) What are homologous structures ? Give an example.<br />
(b) &#8220;The sex of a newborn child is a matter of chance and none of the parents may be considered responsible for it.&#8221; justify this statement with the help of a flow chart showing sex-determination in human beings. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The structures which have the same basic design but different functions are called homologous structures or homologous organs.<br />
Example: Forelimbs of a man, a lizard, a frog they have same basic design of bones but perform different functions.<br />
(b) The sex of a newborn depends on what happens at the time of fertilization.<br />
1. If a sperm carrying X chromosome fertilizes the ovum carrying X chromosome, then the girl child will be born and the child will have XX combination of sex chromosomes.<br />
2. If a sperm carrying Y chromosome fertilizes the ovum carrying X chromosome, then the child born will be a boy and the child will have XY combination of sex chromosome.<br />

The above presentation clearly shows that it is matter of chance whether the newborn will be boy or girl and none of the parents may be considered responsible for it.</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
When do we consider a person to be myopic or hypermetropic ? List two causes of &#8211; hypermetropia. Explain using ray diagrams how the defect associated with hypermetropic eye can be corrected. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Myopia is the defect in vision in which a person cannot see the distant objects clearly whereas in hypermetropia is the defect in which a person cannot see nearby objects clearly. Hypermetropia is caused due to:<br />
1. Decrease in converging power of eye-lens.<br />
2. Too short eye ball.<br />
In a hypermetropic eye, the image of near by object lying at normal near point N (at 25 cm) is formed behind the retina.<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48372247417_295b7ff734_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2019 Outside Delhi Set I Q19" width="413" height="344" /><br />
Hypermetropic eye can be corrected using convex lenses. When a convex lens of suitable power is placed in front of hypermetropic eye, then the diverging rays of light from the object are converged first by the convex lens used. This form a virtual image of the object at another near point N&#8217;.<br />
Now, the rays can be easily focused by the eye lens to form an image on retina.</p>

When key is closed, the current starts flowing through the circuit. Take the reading of ammeter. Now change the position of ammeter to anywhere in between the resistors and take its reading. We will observe that in both the cases reading of ammeter will be same showing same current flows through every part of the circuit above.<br />
(b) Given,<br />
R<sub>1</sub> = 5 Ω, R<sub>2</sub> = 10 Ω, R<sub>3</sub> = 15 Ω, V = 30 V<br />
Total resistance, R = R<sub>1</sub> + R<sub>2</sub> + R<sub>3</sub> [∵ 5 Ω, 10 Ω and 15 Ω are connected in series]<br />
= 5 + 10 + 15<br />
= 30 Ω<br />
Potential difference, V = 30 V<br />
Current in the circuit, I = ?<br />
From Ohm&#8217;s law.<br />
I = \(\frac { V }{ R }\) = \(\frac { 30 }{ 30 }\) = 1 A<br />
Current flowing in the circut = 1 A<br />
Potential difference across 15 Ω resistors = IR3 = 1 × 15 = 15 V<br />

<p>Question 21.<br />
Draw the pattern of magnetic field lines produced around a current-carrying straight conductor passing perpendicularly through horizontal cardboard. State and apply the right-hand thumb rule to mark the direction of the field lines. How will the strength of the magnetic field change when the point where magnetic field is to be determined is moved away from the straight conductor ? Give reason to justify your answer. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Maxwell&#8217;s Right Hand Thumb rule states that if the current-carrying wire is imagined to be held in the right hand so that thumb points in the direction of current, then the direction in which fingers encircle the wire will give the direction of magnetic field lines around the wire. If we hold the current-carrying straight wire so that thumbs Magnetic field pattern due to a straight current-carrying wire in upward direction points the direction of current, the direction of magnetic field lines will be anticlockwise. The strength of the magnetic field is inversely proportional to the distance of the point of observation from the wire. So, as we move away from the wire the strength of magnetic decreases.<br />

Covalent bond (double bond) is present in between C and O.<br />
OR<br />
Two properties of carbon which lead to the huge number of carbon compounds are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Catenation: It is the ability of carbon to form bonds with other atoms of carbon.</li>
<li>Tetravalency: With the valency of four, carbon is capable of bonding with 4 other atoms. This forms huge number of compounds.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Give reason:<br />
(a) Carbonate and sulphide ores are usually converted into oxides during the process of extraction.<br />
(b) Aluminium is a highly reactive metal; still, it is widely used in making cooking utensils. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Carbonate and sulphide ores are usually converted into oxides during the process of extraction because obtaining a metal from its metal oxide is much easier than from metal carbonates and sulphides.<br />
(b) Aluminium is highly reactive metal still it is widely used in making cooking utensils because it reacts with 02 present in air to from aluminium oxide that forms a protective layer and protects the metal from corrosion.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
The power of a lens in +5 diopters. What is the nature and focal length of this lens ? At what distance from this lens should an object be placed so as to get its inverted image of the same size? [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
Given, P = + 5D<br />
We have,<br />
Power, P = \(\frac { 1 }{ f(in meter) }\)<br />
+5 = \(\frac { 1 }{ f }\)<br />
f = \(\frac { 1 }{ 5 }\) m = \(\frac { 100 }{ 5 }\) = 20 cm<br />
Focal length, f = 20 cm (or +20 cm).<br />
Since the focal length of the lens is positive. Therefore, the nature of the lens is convex.<br />
Same size and inverted image is formed when<br />
Magnification, m = -1<br />
Also, m = \(\frac { v }{ u }\)<br />
v = -u<br />
From the lens formula,<br />

<p>Question 7.<br />
Distinguish between pollination and fertilisation. Mention the site and the product of fertilisation in a flower. [3]<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The transfer of pollen grains from anther of a stamen to the stigma of a carpel is called pollination whereas fertilisation is the process when the male gamete present in pollen grain joins the female gamete present in ovule.</li>
<li>Pollination is an external mechanism whereas fertilisation is an internal mechanism which takes place inside the flower.<br />
Site of fertilisation in flower is ovary. Product of fertilisation in flower is zygote.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 10.<br />
List three environmental consequences of using fossil fuels. Suggest three steps to minimise the pollution caused, by various energy sources. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The combustion of fossil fuels releases different harmful products. Three environmental consequences of using fossil fuels are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It releases CO<sub>2</sub> which is a greenhouse gas which traps the solar energy falling on earth and it leads to global warming.</li>
<li>Carbon monoxide is poisonous gas which when enters in the bloodstream stops the functioning of red blood cells to carrying oxygen from lungs to other parts of the body. It also causes death.</li>
<li>Sulphur dioxide released during the burning of fossil fuels is harmful for lungs and causes bronchitis and other diseases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Steps to minimise the pollution caused by various energy sources are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solar cookers should be used to cook food wherever possible.</li>
<li>Use of Biogas as domestic fuel should be encouraged in rural areas.</li>
<li>Three R&#8217;s strategy-Reduce, Reuse and Recycle should be practised.</li>

<p><strong>Section &#8211; D</strong></p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
(a) What are the dominant and recessive traits?<br />
(b) &#8220;Is it possible that a trait is inherited but may not be expressed in the next generation ?&#8221; Give a suitable example to justify this statement. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The trait which can express its effect over contrasting trait is called dominant trait whereas the trait which cannot express its effect over contrasting trait or which gets suppressed by the contrasting trait is called recessive trait. The inherited trait which is not expressed will be a recessive trait.</p>
<p>(b) In Mendel&#8217;s experiment, when pure tall pea plants were crossed with pure dwarf pea plants, only tall pea plants were obtained in F<sub>1</sub> generation. On selfing, the pea plants of F<sub>1</sub> generation both tall and dwarf pea plants were obtained in F<sub>2</sub> generation. The reappearance of the dwarf pea plants in F<sub>2</sub> generation proves that the dwarf trait was inherited but not expressed in F<sub>1</sub> generation. The recessive trait does not express itself in the presence of the dominant trait. So, it is possible that one trait may be inherited but may not be expressed in an organism.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
(a) What is the scattering of light? Explain how the colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles.<br />
(b) Explain the reddish appearance of the Sun at sunrise or sunset. Why does it not appear red at noon? [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Scattering of light is the phenomenon in which a part of the incident light is dispersed in different directions.<br />
Dependence of colour and scattered light on the size of particles:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the particles like dust and water droplets present in the atmosphere are large in size, the scattered light appears white.</li>
<li>When the particles are extremely minute in size, they will scatter blue light present in the white sunlight.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) The reddish appearance of the sun at sunrise &#8216; and sunset is due to the scattering of blue colour present in the sunlight away from our line of sight and leaves behind the mainly red colour of the direct sunlight which reaches the human eye.<br />
The reason for Sun not appearing red at the noon is that the light has to travel a relatively shorter distance through the atmosphere to reach us and therefore, only a litte of blue colour of the white light is scattered.</p>

<p>Question 20.<br />
What is sexual reproduction? Explain how this mode of reproduction gives rise to more viable variations than asexual reproduction. How does this affect evolution? [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
The production of new organisms from two parents by making use of their sex cells is called sexual reproduction.<br />
In sexual reproduction, more viable variations are observed than asexual reproduction as two parents is involved. In the case of asexual reproduction single parent organism gives rise to offsprings which are genetically identical to their parents. This limits the scope of variation in characters of offsprings. Due to sexual reproduction, the extent of variation is much large and therefore choices of evolution is also high.</p>
<p>The variations in the characters of the obtained offsprings from sexual reproduction enable them to adapt according to the environment and struggle for their existence. Over a period of time, the characters accumulate within the species and the formed species give rise to new species and this process goes on.</p>
