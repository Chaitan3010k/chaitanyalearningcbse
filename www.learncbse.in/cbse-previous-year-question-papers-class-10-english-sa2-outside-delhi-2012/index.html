<strong>Question.1. Read the following passage carefully. </strong><br />
<strong>ROMANCING THE RAIL</strong><br />
<strong>1. A couple of weeks ago, while detailing the many ways in which coping with the bleak economy can actually better our lives, I touched upon the romance of train travel and suggested that we would do ^ell to introduce our children to its charms.</strong><br />
<strong>I have to confess that I was surprised by the kind of response this triggered from readers with stories to tell of their own rail adventures.</strong><br />
<strong>2. Browsing through them reminded me yet again why trains have such a special place in our lives. Well, perhaps not in the lives of a generation brought up on the dubious pleasure of cheap air travel.</strong><br />
<strong>3. I still vividly recall every detail of my first such excursion, taking a train from Sealdah station in Calcutta to visit my aunt&#8217;s tea garden in Assam. I settled down at my window seat and even before the train had pulled out, I was burrowing deep into the pleasures of Indian mythology.</strong><br />
<strong>4. But as the scene outside grew more rustic, even picturesque, my attention wandered to the marvellous moving display outside my window. There were gentle rolling fields, green and lush, more palm trees than I could count and endless expanse of bright blue sky.</strong><br />
<strong>5. Just then, a man entered my peripheral vision. Scythe in hand, he was intently cutting down some tall grass in the fields. &#8220;Oh look,&#8221; I cried out to my mother, &#8220;It&#8217;s a farmer, a real-life farmer!&#8221; A city- bred child, I hadn&#8217;t realized until then that farmers actually had an independent existence outside of my story books.</strong><br />
<strong>6. That wasn&#8217;t the only discovery I made in the course of that first train journey or the many others to follow. Gazing out of the train window as I travelled across the country, I was introduced to a new India that was far removed from the bland boundaries of my middle-class urban existence.

<p><strong>Question.2. Read the following passage carefully: </strong><br />
<strong>1. Although everybody has a creative spark, the potential is not always fully utilised. How does one recognize those who are developing their creative energies to the fullest? Mad painters and tormented poets are only comic stereotypes of the creative personality. The essential traits of creativity are found among a wide variety of less conspicuous creators, people in all walks of life. Unfortunately, the structure of our social and educational environment does not always promote its growth.</strong><br />
<strong>2. Generally speaking, creative people often believe their purpose in life is to discover and implement the interrelatedness of things, to make order out of disorder. They also see problems where others see none and question the validity of even the most widely accepted answers. Creative persons are compulsive problem seekers, not so much because they thrive on problems, but because their senses are attuned to a world that demands to be put together, like a jigsaw puzzle scattered on a table.</strong><br />
<strong>3. Several tests now in use reveal that highly creative people are much more open and receptive to the complexities of experience than are less creative people. The creative temperament has a tendency to break problems down into their most basic elements and then reconstruct them iijto whole new problems, thereby discovering new relationships and new solutions.</strong><br />
<strong>4. Highly creative people aren&#8217;t afraid to ask what may seem to be naive or silly questions. They ask questions like, &#8220;why don&#8217;t spiders get tangled up in their own webs?&#8221; and &#8220;why do dogs turn in circles before lying down?&#8221;. Such questions may seem childlike, and in a way they are. Children have not yet had their innate creative energies channelled into culturally acceptable directions and can give full rein to their curiosity—the absolute prerequisite for full creative functioning, in both children and adults.</strong><br />
<strong>5. Unlike children, creative people appear to have vast stores of patience to draw upon. Months, years, even decades can be devoted to a single problem.</strong><br />
<strong>6. The home that encourages inquisitiveness contributes to creative development. The</strong><br />
<strong>teacher who stresses questions rather than answers and rewards curiosity rather than restricting is teaching a child to be creative.</strong><br />
<strong>7. To be extremely intelligent is not the same as to be gifted in creative work. Tire Quiz Kids are often referred to as geniuses. They would undoubtedly score high in memory functions But it is doubtful whether they are also fluent in producing ideas.</strong><br />
<strong>8. Contrary to popular myths that glorify youth, more creative achievements are likely to occur when people grow older. While memory may falter with age, creativity is ageless.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question.2.1. On the basis of your reading of the passage, answer the following questions briefly: 8</strong><br />
<strong>(a) Why is every person not able to use his/her creativity fully?</strong><br />
<strong>(b) Write any two traits of creative people that you get to know from the passage.</strong><br />
<strong>(c) What are the most essential prerequisites for full creative functioning in children and adults?</strong><br />
<strong>(d) What kind of homes and teachers promote creativity among children?</strong><br />
<strong>Answer.</strong>(a) Every person has a creative spark but his/her potential is not always fully utilised.<br />
The structure of our social and educational environment does not promote the growth of creativity.<br />
(b) (i) They believe their purpose in life is to discover and implement the interrelatedness of things.<br />
(ii) They question the validity of even the most widely accepted answers of problems.<br />
(c) For full creative functioning one must not be afraid to ask what may seem like childlike questions but are an important prerequisite for full creativity.<br />
(d) A home that encourages inquisitiveness contributes to creative development. A teacher who stresses questions rather than restricting promotes creativity among children.</p>

Subject: Yet again, rainy %eason deteriorates roads<br />
Sir<br />
Through the medium of this letter I wish to express my grievance against the miserable condition of the roads with the onset of the rainy season, which has become a yearly affair.<br />
Roads filled with rain water makes it uneasy for travellers to commute. Tyres of vehicles get buried in these marshy roads and two-wheelers skid and fall-off on them. These problems are faced by the people every year once the rainy season begins and unfortunately the concerned departments turn a blind eye to the inconvenience caused to the public. Roads are the lifelines of an economy and vital activities come to a standstill due to the irresponsible attitude of the authorities. Year after year these roads are rebuilt but unfortunately work is not done according to specifications and sub-standard building material is used. The worst affected in all this is the common man.<br />
I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that action is initiated and good quality construction material is used to repair roads with proper monitoring so that unnecessary public inconvenience can be avoided.<br />
Yours Sincerely Ram<br />

Harmful Effects of Global Warming<br />
&#8211; By: Ankita<br />
When it comes to global warming, its harmful effects like melting polar ice caps, weather changes and an increase in diseases are alarming and these will ultimately affect our lives. When temperature rises ice caps in the Arctic region are likely to melt and this will lead to a rise in the water level in the seas. This rise in water level may cause floods in coastal areas, threatening the lives of the people living there. It is high time we realize how our careless acts of destruction like felling of trees and burning of fossil fuels are endangering our own existence on earth. Global warming is not something whose effects will be felt years later, it is already affecting our lives. The increased frequency of weather extremes is causing irreversible climatic changes across the world. The recent scorching weather is not purely natural. Neither is the increasingly volatile weather that is wrecking havoc in certain parts of the globe. We humans are causing global warming and we are suffering as a result and the consequences are only likely to get graver.</p>

<strong> Answer. </strong>It was a cold and windy night. My friend and me met after a long time and were chatting for hours. We did not notice that time flew away and it was close to ten. We decided to take an auto rickshaw to go to our room. It started raining and we hurried to get into an auto rickshaw and reach our place. None of the auto rickshaws stopped for us, except one. The driver asked us where we wanted to go and we told the place. Without talking anything about the fare, he said, &#8216;please get in!&#8217; We thanked the auto driver for stopping for us. Since it was very cold, I asked the driver to stop in the mid at any small restaurant or a tea shop. We liked to have a cup of hot tea. The driver stopped near a small restaurant. We ordered for tea and asked the driver to join us and have a cup of tea. The driver refused. I insisted him to take a cup as it could be refreshing. Again the driver refused to drink tea.<br />
My friend asked, &#8216;Will you not take tea from this shop or what?&#8217; Driver replied, &#8216;No Sir, I don&#8217;t feel like having tea now.&#8217;<br />
I asked again, &#8216;But, why? A cup of tea will make no harm.&#8217;<br />
The driver with all smiles replied, &#8216;Thank you sir, but I&#8217;m sorry.&#8217;<br />
My friend asked, &#8216;Do you have any habit that you won&#8217;t eat outside?&#8217;<br />
The driver said, &#8216;No!&#8217; My friend became angry on the driver, &#8216;You think we are not equal to share a cup of tea with you?&#8217; The driver remained silent and never replied. I was really surprised at his behaviour and asked my friend not to compel him.<br />

A young boy was travelling by train for work from Delhi to Chandigarh. He was all of twenty years and had recently joined his father&#8217;s business. He was on his maiden work trip. He was carrying a briefcase which contained a lot of money as he was going to Chandigarh to purchase some raw material for his factory. During his journey, he befriended a fellow passenger who appeared to be a -rather nice man. The boy and the passenger struck a friendly conversation and spent most part of the journey talking to each . other about their respective lives and even shared their food at dinner time. About half an hour before reaching Chandigarh, the train halted at a station. On seeing an ice-cream vendor, the young boy decided to go out and buy ice-cream for himself and his new friend. When he returned back after a few minutes, he was met with a rather rude shock. Not only was his fellow traveller missing, his briefcase with lots of money in it was also gone.</p>

<strong> (d) ‘We&#8217;re going on strike!&#8217; Explain the context.</strong><br />
<strong> (e) What makes the author refrain from killing the snake?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) The first computer game played by Michael was called &#8216;Wild West&#8217;. The strange thing<br />
that happened as he was play ing it was the appearance of the second sheriff who was not like the other characters. He was about Michael&#8217;s age and though he looked like a computer image, he did not move like one.<br />
(b) The conspirators clarify that they have been forced to slay Caesar in the general interest of the people and country of Rome, but for him (Antony) their swords have blunt edges. They alsa tell Antony that they would like to receive him in their company with kind love and good thoughts and he would have an equal say in the government and in handing out new honours and position.<br />
(c) The mariners felt that the old sailor had done a &#8216;hellish thing&#8217; by killing the albatross. They blamed him for his cruel act and were sure that it would bring them a curse. They condemned the act of the ancient mariner for killing an innocent bird whose arrival has signalled a good omen for them.<br />
(d) Helen, the ghost, tells John Hallock that she and the other ghosts who were part of &#8216;The Writer&#8217;s Inspiration Bureau&#8217;, were going on strike and so writers like him would not get ideas for another plot from them. She and her companions were fed-up of being called out of their beds, at odd hours, a little too often to answer silly questions of humans who sat on Ouija boards and this strike was their way of retaliation.<br />
(e) The author refrains from killing the snake because at first he feared the snake and then he felt honoured that a snake had come as a guest to seek his hospitality by coming to quench his thirst at his (the author&#8217;s) water-trough.<br />
Question.10. The idea of ghosts and haunting have fascinated people for&#8217; centuries. John Hallock could be the only person who encountered a ghost but many others dedicate their lives searching for paranormal activity.<br />

Answer. The Mysterious Creatures of the Other World<br />
The mystery of the supernatural world has forever baffled people and so they always have many misconceptions about it. It is believed the supernatural world and its creatures are not subjected to +he laws of nature or, putting it more figuratively, they exist above and beyond nature Supporters of the supernatural explanations believe, that the past, present and future complexities and the existence of<br />
supernatural creatures cannot be explained by any naturalistic means and argue that it is reasonable to assume that a non-natural entity resolves the unexplained. Even when we read fantasy and fictional accounts of ghosts and supernatural occurrences, a wall of separation exists, that of reality versus unreality. We must beware of crossing the line because many dangers are likely to be connected with this occult.<br />

Patol Babu had for long struggled hard to make a living. So despite the fact that he needed money very badly he left the place before he was paid. He went to the film shooting and even after finding out that his role was very small, he put a lot of effort and rehearsed his scene many times. The mere satisfaction that he had given a good performance far superceded everything else. He felt that the remuneration he would be given would be rather insignificant when measured against the intense feeling of contentment at a job done with perfection and dedication. It is strange that although he was in desperate need of money he chose to walk away from there without informing anyone. Patol Babu was so passionate about acting that despite all the past years of struggle he could conveniently ignore the money factor only for the feeling of being extremely satisfied by his miniscule performance.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong> When 350 planes dropped half a million kilos of bombs on Ijmuiden, the houses trembled like a wisp of grass in the wind and resulted in numerous epidemics. After the raids people had to line up for vegetables and all kinds of other necessities. Doctors were unable to visit the sick, because if they turned their backs on their cars for a moment, they were stolen, burglaries and theft abound, so much so that one wonders what had taken hold of the Dutch for them suddenly to have become such thieves.

They heard of the cruel, unnecessary fighting in the faraway Pacific and learned of the struggles going on between capital and labour. Helen knew that beyond the border of their haven, men were making history by sweating their brows when they might better make a holiday. She was sure.these things would pass awav. There were lakes and woods, flowers and fields and beautiful meadows, that they shall enjoy forever Anne Sullivan was a life long teacher and companion to Helen Keller. Her arrival brought about a miraculous change in Helen&#8217;s life and the world became more meaningful and full of things quivering with life for Helen. Miss Sullivan was extremely sensitive and so she had an inexplicable sympathy with Helen&#8217;s pleasures and desires. She came up with the most interesting and novel ways to tutor Helen. Miss Sullivan&#8217;s sympathy, genius and loving nature made the first few years of Helen&#8217;s education most joyous and beautiful. Time and again she provided Helen with the much needed courage and hope and it was due to her consistent patience and perseverance that Helen came out of her dark and sordid world.</p>

Subject: Importance of reading for children Sir<br />
Through the medium of this letter I wish to express my concern, as a parent on the disappearance of the habit of reading from the lives of our children in the present times. Reading has and will always play a significant role in shaping the lives of children It develops their mind by helping it to grow in its ability. It also develops their language skills and imagination. While reading children develop their cognitive skills and acquire definite directions by which they are able to think, realize and fully comprehend those concepts that may at first seem out of the world. When children make reading an integral part of their lives they are able to improve their communication and vocabulary skills. Let us not forget that people who read and loved books have been able to shape their personalities in the most positive way.<br />
I would like to conclude my letter with a quote by Burke Hedges — &#8220;Reading, like no other medium, can transform your life in a flash and you never know which book at which time in your life might be the one that rocks your world and inspires you to grow in ways you never thought possible.&#8221;<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
Prema</p>

<p><strong>Question.9. Answer any four of the following questions in 30-40 words each:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Why did Patol Babu leave for Calcutta?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Which mean act is the poet referring to in the poem, &#8216;Snake&#8217;?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) What explanation did Michael find for Sebastian Shultz&#8217;s miraculous recovery?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) How did Decius Brutus interpret Calpumia&#8217;s dream?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) &#8216;We&#8217;re going on strike.&#8217; Explain.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer. </strong>(a) Patol Babu used to live in Kanchrapara and worked in the railway factory there. When he was offered higher pay in a clerical post with Hudson &amp; Kimberley, in Calcutta (Kolkata) and also found a flat in Nepal Bhattacharji Lane, then he gave up his factory job and came to Calcutta.<br />
(b) The mean act that the poet is referring to in the poem &#8216;Snake&#8217; is his action of throwing a log at the snake. As the snake puts his head into the hole and retreats into the earth, the poet is filled with a protest against the idea of the snake withdrawing into this hole. He puts down his pitcher, picks up a log and hurls it at the snake.<br />
(c) Michael checked the net and found out that at the time of the accident, Sebastian was playing a psycho-drive game on his laptop. His memory was saved in the computer when he banged his head on it during the accident. These psycho-drive games were stolen from his house and ended up at the Computer Fair where Michael and his dad had bought them and then Sebastian&#8217;s memory had got transferred into Michael&#8217;s computer.<br />
(d) Calpumia dreams of Caesar being murdered. She sees blood oozing out of his statue and many smiling Romans coming and bathing their hands in it. Decius Brutus interprets the dream as a fair and fortunate vision. He says the vision of Romans bathing in Caesar&#8217;s blood signifies that Caesar&#8217;s great life will influence so many Roman people who will gather around him and stain their handkerchiefs in his blood which will serve as colours added to a coat of arms. He tactfully changes the meaning of the dream and states his blood was to be taken as a token of great reverence.<br />
(e) Helen, the ghost, tells John Hallock that she and the other ghosts who were part of &#8216;The Writer&#8217;s Inspiration Bureau&#8217;, were going on strike and so writers like him would not get ideas for another plot from them. She and her companions were fed-up of being called out of their beds, at odd hours, a little too often to answer silly questions of humans who sat on Ouija boards and this strike was their way of retaliation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SET III</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Note: Except for the following questions, all the remaining questions have been asked in Set-I and Set-II.</strong><br />
<strong> Question.5. Choose the appropriate options from the ones given below to complete the following passage. Write the answers in your answer sheet against the correct blank numbers:</strong><br />
<strong> The world we live in (a)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. changed a great deal (b)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. the last hundred years</strong><br />
<strong> and it is likely to change (c) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. more in the next hundred. Some people would like to stop these changes and go back to what they see (d)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; a pure and simple age. But history (e)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.that the past was not (f) &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;wonderful.</strong><br />
<strong> (a) (i) will       (ii) are        (iii) have       (iv) has</strong><br />
<strong> (b) (i) to          (ii) in           (iii) on          (iv) since</strong><br />

<strong> (d) (i) it            (ii) has        (iii) in          (iv) as</strong><br />
<strong> (e) (i) shown (ii) told      (iii) shows    (iv) feels</strong><br />
<strong> (f) (i) some    (ii) that       (iii) what     (iv) any</strong><br />

(d) (iv) as       (e) (iii) shows       (f) (ii) that</p>
<p><strong>Question.9. Answer any four of the following .questions in 30-40 words each:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) What does his &#8216;voice of education&#8217; tell the poet?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) What was common in all the computer games played by Michael?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) How did Caesar make the Romans his heirs?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) Why did John want his wife to get rid of the Ouija board she had bought?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why did Patol Babu leave for Calcutta?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer</strong>.(a) His &#8216;voice of education&#8217; tells the poet that the golden brown poisonous snake should be killed and as a brave man he must undertake the task of killing it. He associates the snake with evil and so it assumes a more ominous meaning, making the poet&#8217;s urge to destroy it even greater. .<br />
(b) Sebastian Shultz&#8217; memory appeared before Michael in every game with one single appeal that he (Michael) had to save him. Sebastian Shultz was the game and in all the computer games that Michael played, he gave him instructions and urged him to continue until he finally won.<br />
(c) Caesar, in his will, gave seventy five drachmas to each Roman. He also left his private gardens and orchards on the side of the Tiber river for the recreation of the Romans and their future generations. He had thus made the Romans his heirs.<br />
(d) Helen, the ghost, had told John that she and her companions were going on strike because the Ouija board fanatics had began troubling them incessantly. Helen had thus requested John to exert his influence and get all his friends to stop using the Ouija board. So John wanted his wife to get rid of the Ouija board she had bought.<br />
(e) Patol Babu used to live in Kanchrapara and worked in the railway factory there. When he was offered higher pay in a clerical post with Hudson &amp; Kimberley, in Calcutta (Kolkata) and also found a flat in Nepal Bhattacharji Lane, then he gave up his factory job and came to Calcutta.</p>
