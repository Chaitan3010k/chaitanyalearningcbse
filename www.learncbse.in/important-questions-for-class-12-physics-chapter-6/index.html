<h4>Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
A plot of magnetic flux (ϕ ) versus current (I) is shown in the figure for two inductors A and B. Which of the two has larger value of self inductance? (Delhi 2010)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117540" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-94.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 94" width="135" height="104" /><br />
Answer:<br />
Since ϕ = LI<br />
∴ L = \(\frac{\phi}{I}\) = slope<br />
Slope of A is greater than slope of B<br />
∴ Inductor A has larger value of self inductance than inductor B.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Define self-inductance of a coil. Write its S.I. unit. (All India 2010)<br />
Answer:<br />
Self induction is the property of a coil by virtue of which it opposes the growth or decay of the current flowing through it.<br />
S.I. unit of self-inductance is henry (H).</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Two bar magnets are quickly moved towards a metallic loop connected across a capacitor &#8216;C&#8217; as shown in the figure. Predict the polarity of the capacitor. (All India 2013)<br />

Answer:<br />
When both magnets move towards loop, the A side plate of cL capacitor will be positive while the lower plate B is negative, making the induced current in a clockwise direction.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117377" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-1.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 1" width="212" height="78" /></p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Predict the polarity of the capacitor when the two magnets are quickly moved in the directions marked by arrows.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117379" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-2.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 2" width="281" height="84" /><br />
Answer:<br />
Curerent in the coil will be anti-clockwise, when seen from the left, therefore plate A will become + ve (positive) and plate B will be negative.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Predict the directions of induced currents in metal rings 1 and 2 lying in the same plane where current I in the wire is increasing steadily.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117380" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-3.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 3" width="138" height="68" /><br />

<p>Question 43.<br />
State Lenz&#8217;s Law.<br />
A metallic rod held horizontally along east-west direction, is allowed to fall under gravity. Will there be an emf induced at its ends? Justify your answer. (Delhi 2012)<br />

<p>Question 50.<br />
(i) State Faraday&#8217;s law of electromagnetic induction.<br />
(ii) A jet plane is travelling towards west at a speed of 1800 km/h. What is the voltage difference developed between the ends of the wing having a span of 25 m, if the Earth&#8217;s magnetic field at the location has a magnitude of 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> T and the dip angle is 30°? (All India)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) First law : Whenever the magnetic flux linked with a closed circuit changes, an emf (and hence a current) is induced in it which lasts only so long as the change in flux is taking place. This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction.<br />
Second law : The magnitude of the induced emf is equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux linked with the closed circuit.<br />

⇒ ϕ  = LI where [L is called coefficient of self induction]<br />

<p>Question 57.<br />
Define the term &#8216;mutual inductance&#8217; between the two coils.<br />
Obtain the expression for mutual inductance of a pair of long coaxial solenoids each of length l and radii r<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> (r<sub>2</sub> &gt;&gt; r<sub>1</sub>). Total number of turns in the two solenoids are N<sub>1</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> respectively. (All India 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Mutual inductance. The mutual inductance of two coils is numerically equal to the induced emf produced in one coil, when the rate of change of current is unit in the other coil.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117427" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-50.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 50" width="130" height="53" /><br />
(ii)</p>
<p>(a) Lenz&#8217;s law (Direction) : “The direction of induced current in a circuit is such as to oppose<br />
the change that causes it. So \(e m f=-\frac{d \phi}{d t}\)<br />
When north pole of a magnet, for example, is brought near a coil, then the nearer end of the coil will acquire north polarity and mechanical work will be needed to cause the relative motion between the coil and the magnet. This work, in fact, converts itself in the form of induced emf. Hence, the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.</p>
<p>(b) When a current I<sub>2</sub> is set up through S<sub>2</sub>, it in turn sets up a magnetic flux through S<sub>1</sub>. Let us denote it by ϕ<sub>1</sub>. The corresponding flux linkage with solenoid S<sub>1</sub> is<br />

M<sub>12</sub> is called the mutual inductance of solenoid S<sub>1</sub> with respect to solenoid S<sub>2</sub>.<br />
The magnetic field due to the current I<sub>2</sub> in S<sub>2</sub><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117451" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-71.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 71" width="347" height="137" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-71.png 347w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-71-300x118.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 347px) 100vw, 347px" /><br />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117452" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-72.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 72" width="295" height="23" /><br />
M<sub>21</sub> is called the mutual inductance of the solenoid S<sub>2</sub> with respect to solenoid S<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>The flux due to the current I<sub>1</sub> in S<sub>1</sub> can be assumed to be confined solely inside S<sub>1</sub> since the solenoid are very long. Thus, flux linkage with solenoid S<sub>2</sub> is<br />

<p>Question 58.<br />
Define the term self-inductance of a solenoid. Obtain the expression for the magnetic energy stored in an inductor of self-inductance L to build up a current I through it. (All India 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
Self-inductance: emf is induced in a single isolated coil due to change of flux through the coil by means of varying the current through the same coil. This phenomenon is called self-induction. In this case, flux linkage through a coil of N turns is proportional to the current through the coil and is expressed as<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117428" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-51.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 51" width="208" height="31" /><br />
where constant of proportionality L is called self-inductance of the coil. It is also called the coefficient of self-induction of the coil. When the current is varied, the flux linked with the coil also changes and an emf is induced in the coil. Using the above equation the induced emf is given by<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117429" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-52.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 52" width="216" height="51" /><br />
Thus, the self-induced emf always opposes any change (increase or decrease) of current in the coil. It is possible to calculate the self-inductance for circuits with simple geometries. Let us calculate the self-inductance of a long solenoid of cross-sectional area A and length Z, having n turns per unit length. The magnetic field due to a current I flowing in the solenoid is B = µ<sub>0</sub>nI (neglecting edge effects, as before). The total flux linked with the solenoid is<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117430" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-53.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 53" width="367" height="85" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-53.png 367w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-53-300x69.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 367px) 100vw, 367px" /><br />
If we fill the inside of the solenoid with a material of relative permeability (e.g. soft iron, which has a high value of relative permiability), then L = µ<sub>r</sub>µ<sub>0</sub>n<sup>2</sup>Al</p>
<p>The self-inductance of the coil depends on its geometry and on the permeability of the medium. The self-induced emf is also called the back emf as it opposes any change in the current in a circuit. Physically, the self-inductance plays the role of inertia. It is the electromagnetic analogue of mass in mechanics. So, work needs to be done against the back emf (ε) in establishing the current. This work done is stored as magnetic potential energy. For the current I at an instant in a circuit, the rate of work done is<br />

<p>Question 61.<br />
(i) Define mutual inductance.<br />
(ii) A pair of adjacent coils has a mutual inductance of 1.5 H. If the current in one coil changes from 0 to 20 A in 0.5 s, what is the change of flux linkage with the other coil? (Delhi 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Mutual inductance : Magnetic flux, linked with the secondary coil due to the unit current flowing in the primary coil, \(\phi_{2}=\mathrm{MI}_{1}\)<br />
Therefore, induced emf associated with the secondary coil, for a unit rate of change of current in the primary coil. \(e_{2}=-\mathrm{M} \frac{d l_{1}}{d t}\)<br />

As shown in the diagram (a) given, when the north pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the close coil, the magnetic flux through the coil increases and the current is induced in the coil in such a direction that it opposes the increase in flux. This is possible when the induced current in the coil is in the anticlockwise direction.</p>
<p>Similarly as shown in the diagram (b), just the opposite happens when the north pole is moved away from the coil.</p>
<p>In either case, it is the work done against the force of magnetic repulsion or attraction that gets &#8216;converted&#8217; into the induced emf.</p>

(ii) the external force required to move the arm, and<br />
(iii) the power dissipated as heat. (All India 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Eddy current : Due to change in magnetic flux, if there is induced current in the volume (bulk) of the material, it is called as eddy currents. It is a necessary evil in an arrangement as it can be used in applications like electric brakes, induction furnaces and dead-beat galvanometers and brings loss of energy with heat production etc.<br />

(a) State Lenz&#8217;s law. Give one example to illustrate this law. &#8220;The Lenz&#8217;s law is a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy.&#8221; Justify this statement.<br />
(b) Deduce an expression for the mutual inductance of two long coaxial solenoids but having different radii and different number of turns. (All India 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Lenz&#8217;s law (Direction) : “The direction of induced current in a circuit is such as to oppose<br />
the change that causes it. So \(e m f=-\frac{d \phi}{d t}\)<br />
When north pole of a magnet, for example, is brought near a coil, then the nearer end of the coil will acquire north polarity and mechanical work will be needed to cause the relative motion between the coil and the magnet. This work, in fact, converts itself in the form of induced emf. Hence, the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction is in accordance with the law of conservation of energy.</p>

When the north pole of a bar magnet is pushed towards the coil, the amount of magnetic flux linked with the coil increases. Current is induced in the coil from a direction such that it opposes the increase in magnetic flux. This is possible only when the current induced in the coil is in anti-clockwise direction, with respect to an observer.<br />
The magnetic movement ➝ M associated with this induced emf has north polarity towards the north pole of the approaching bar magnet.</p>
<p>Similarly, when the north pole of the bar magnet is moved away from the coil, the magnetic flux linked with the coil decreases. To counter this decrease in magnetic flux, current is induced in the coil in clockwise direction so that its south pole faces the receding north pole of the bar magnet. This would result in an attractive force which opposes the motion of the magnet and the corresponding decrease in magnetic flux.</p>

Answer:<br />
(a) Mutual inductance of two coils is equal to the magnetic flux linked with one coil when a unit current is passed in the other coil.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117464" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-82.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 82" width="228" height="61" /><br />

S.I. unit : Henry, (Weber ampere<sup>-1</sup>) or (volt second ampere<sup>-1</sup>)</p>
<p>(b) Consider two long solenoids S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> of same length l such that solenoid S<sub>2</sub> surrounds S<sub>1</sub> completely.<br />
Let a current I<sub>2</sub> flow through S<sub>2</sub>. This sets up a magnetic flux ϕ<sub>1</sub> through each turn of the coil S<sub>1</sub><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117465" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-83.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 83" width="265" height="236" /><br />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117468" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-6-Electromagnetic-Induction-Class-12-Important-Questions-86.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 6 Electromagnetic Induction Class 12 Important Questions 86" width="251" height="94" /><br />
(b) A jet plane is travelling towards west at a speed of 1800 km/h.<br />
(i) Estimate voltage difference developed between the ends of the wing having a span of 25 m if the earth&#8217;s magnetic field at the location has a magnitude of 5 × 10<sup>-4</sup> T and dip angle is 30°.<br />
(ii) How will the voltage developed be affected if the jet changes its direction from west to north? (Comptt. All India)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Lenz&#8217;s law : It states that &#8220;the direction of induced emf is such that it tends to produce a current which opposes the change in magnetic flux producing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Polarity of capacitor: Current induced in the coil will oppose the approach of the magnet, therefore, left face of the coil will act as N-pole and right face S-pole. For this the current in coil will be anticlockwise, as seen from left; and hence the plate &#8216;A&#8217; of the capacitor will be positive and plate &#8216;B&#8217; will be negative.</p>
