<h3>CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 12 English 2019 Outside Delhi Set &#8211; I</h3>
<p><strong>SECTION &#8211; A</strong></p>
<p>(READING) 30</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [20]</p>
<p>1. The sage of science, Einstein, was sitting in a depressive and pensive mood one evening. His eyes were brimming with tears. The pain was evident on his face. He peeped out of the window of his room. The sun had set a few minutes back. The sky was filled with a reddish glow. At this sunset, he felt that it was humanity that had sunk into devilish darkness and the reddish glow in the sky was the blood of humanity spilling all over the sky from earth. With tired steps, he walked back to his chair and settled down. It was the 9th of August 1945. Three days back, he had felt the same agony as if someone had tom him apart. He was deeply hurt and depressed when he heard on the radio that America had dropped an atom bomb on the Japanese city, Hiroshima. Today, within three days another bomb was dropped on another city, Nagasaki and lakhs of people had been killed.</p>
<p>2. He had heard that the blast released so much energy that it had paled all past destructions in comparison and death had played out a pitiable dance of destruction. The flames that broke out of the bomb were burning, melting and exploding buildings. Scared of the heat of the bomb, people had jumped into lakes and rivers, but the water was boiling and the people too were burnt and killed. The animals in the water were already boiled to death. Animals, trees, herbs, fragrant flowering plants were all turned into ashes. The atomic energy destruction had just not stopped there. It had entered the atmosphere there and had spread radiation that would affect people for generations to come and would also bring about destructive irreversible biological change in animals and plants.</p>
<p>3. As the news of the atomic attack reached Einstein, and he became aware of the glaring horror of the abuse of atomic energy, his distress and restlessness knew no bounds. He could not control himself and picked up his violin to turn his mind on to other things. While playing the violin, he tried to dissolve his distress in its sad notes, but couldn&#8217;t. He was burning on the embers of destruction; his heart was filled with an ocean of agony and tears just continued streaming uncontrollably out of his eyes. Night had fallen. His daughter came up and asked him to eat something as he had not taken anything for the last four days. His voice was restrained and he said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel like eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>4. He could not sleep that night. Lying down, he was thinking how he had drawn the attention of the then American President Roosevelt towards the destructive powers of an atomic bomb. He had thought that this would be used to scare Hitler and put an end to the barbarism that Hitler was up to. However, Roosevelt kept him in the dark and made false promises. Eventually, he had abused Einstein&#8217;s equation of E = mc<sup>2</sup> that resulted in the destructive experiments. His actions had made science and scientists as murderers. Einstein kept on thinking for a long time. Eventually, he slipped into sleep. When he woke up at dawn, there was a new dawn in him too. The atomic threat had transformed his heart.</p>
<p>5. The next day, he decided to disassociate himself from the scientific policy of the government and all governmental institutions. He decided to open educational institutions for children, adolescents and youth—institutions where along with science, spirituality will be compulsorily taught.</p>
<p>6. To inaugurate this institution, he had invited two great philosophers, Bertrand Russell and Albert Schweitzer. Ten other great scientists who had own Nobel Prizes in different fields were also invited. They all saw a different Einstein, not a great scientist but a sage in him. The institution was opened by garlanding a photo of Mahatma Gandhi. While garlanding the Mahatma, he became emotional and said with a lump in his throat, &#8220;I bow down to the great man who fought for the independence of his country through non-violence. He could do so because he was a truthful man and true spiritualist.&#8221;</p>
<p>7. Those who teach science should be taught, spirituality too. Without harmony between science and spirituality, the destruction would continue unabated. A few years after this institution was built, a Japanese delegation came to meet him. Einstein broke down in the meeting and said. &#8220;You can give me any punishment and I will accept it. Anyway, I have decided to lead my life in penitence.&#8221; The Japanese were moved by this sincerity and forgot their grief.</p>
<p>Question 1.1.<br />
On the basis of your understanding of the above passage, answer each of the questions given below by choosing the most appropriate option : [1 × 5 = 5]</p>
<p>(a) Besides two great philosophers how many other scientists were invited by Einstein to inaugurate the institution where spirituality would be compulsorily taught?<br />
(i) Five<br />
(ii) Ten<br />
(iii) Eight<br />
(iv) Fifteen<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below carefully and answer the questions that follow: [10]<br />
1. To live in harmony with oneself and the environment is the wish of every human. However, in modem times greater physical and emotional demands are constantly placed upon many areas of life. More and more people suffer from physical and mental tension such as stress, anxiety, insomnia, and there is an imbalance in physical activity and proper exercise. This is why methods and techniques for the attainment and improvement of health, as well as physical, mental and spiritual harmony, are of great importance, and Yoga meets this requirement.</p>
<p>2. The word &#8220;Yoga&#8221; originates from Sanskrit and means &#8220;to join, to unite&#8221;. Yoga exercises have a holistic effect and bring body, mind, consciousness and soul into a balance. In this way Yoga assists us in coping with everyday demands, problems and worries. Yoga helps to develop a greater understanding of our self, the purpose of life and our relationship with God.</p>
<p>3. On the spiritual path, Yoga leads us to supreme knowledge and eternal bliss in the union of the individual Self with the universal Self. Yoga is that supreme, cosmic principle. It is the light of life, the universal creative consciousness that is always awake and never sleeps, that always was, always is, always will be.</p>
<p>4. Many thousands of years ago in India, Rishis (wise men and saints) explored nature and the eosmos in their meditations. They discovered the laws of the material and spiritual realms and gained an insight into the connection within the universe. They investigated the cosmic laws, the laws of nature and the elements, life on earth and the powers and energies at work in the universe—both in the external world and on a spiritual level. The unity of matter and energy, the origin of the universe and the effects of the elementary powers have been described and explained in the Vedas. Much of this knowledge has been rediscovered and confirmed by modem science.</p>
<p>5. From these experiences and insight a far-reaching and comprehensive system known as Yoga originated and gave us valuable, practical instructions for the body, breathing, concentration, relaxation and meditation. The system &#8220;Yoga in Daily Life&#8221; is taught worldwide in Yoga Centres, Adult Education Centres, Health Institutions, Fitness and Sports Clubs, Rehabilitation Centres and Health Resorts. It is suitable for all age groups—the name itself indicates that Yoga can be and should be used &#8220;in Daily Life&#8221;.</p>
<p>6. The exercise levels have been worked out in consultation with doctors and physiotherapists and can therefore — with observation of the stated rules and precautions—be practiced independently at home by anyone. &#8220;Yoga in Daily Life&#8221; is a holistic system, which means it takes into consideration not only the physical, but also the mental and spiritual aspects. Positive thinking, perseverance, discipline, orientation towards the Supreme, prayer as well as kindness and understanding form the way to Self-Knowledge and Self-Realisation.</p>
<p>Question 2.1.<br />

<p>SUMMARY</p>
<p>Today, people face greater physical and mental problems in their daily lives. These problems are related to lack of physical, mental and spiritual harmony. Yoga helps bridge this gap. &#8220;Yoga&#8221; originated from a Sanskrit word that means &#8220;to join&#8221; or &#8220;to unite&#8221;. Yoga exercises balance of body, mind, consciousness and soul. This in a way, helps us to tackle various problems that afflict us in our day-to-day life. The practice of Yoga has been prevalent since ancient times as prescribed in the Vedas. &#8220;Yoga in daily life&#8221; provides practical instructions for the body, breathing, concentration, relaxation and meditation. Yoga paves the way from self-knowledge to self-realization.</p>

The floods that caused a lot of death and destruction in &#8216;God&#8217;s own land, has left behind a trail of victims a year after it wreaked havoc in the state. These survivors of the flood are still struggling to deal with the consequences on their own. They are dealing with the physical damage as well as the mental and emotional trauma that comes with having survived the event without those that are dear to them. These people have lost their livelihood and some have even lost mobility and structure.<br />
I request you to highlight their plight in the newspaper. They are in need of the basic necessities and more. Any help offered by the government and the people reading this, would make a world of change in their lives.<br />

<p>Question 5.<br />
You are concerned about the cleanliness of parks, roads and even your school premises. In spite of various measures taken by local and school administration, lack of cleanliness is still a problem. You are Namita/Keshav. Prepare a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly of your school on the topic, &#8216;Cleanliness is the Responsibility of All/ [10]<br />
OR<br />
Write a debate in 150 &#8211; 200 words either for or against the motion:<br />
&#8216;Stray dogs should not be put to sleep&#8217;.<br />
Answer:<br />
CLEANLINESS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ALL</p>
<p>Honorable Principal, teachers and all my dear friends, Good Morning to all!<br />
I am Keshav/Namita of class XII C. It&#8217;s a great honour for me to stand before everyone and deliver a speech on the importance of cleanliness. Today, I would like to address the idea of cleanliness in our locality. Specifically, I would like to talk about cleanliness in public spaces such as parks and roads as well as other spaces that host large groups of people simultaneously such as our school.</p>
<p>Local authorities have taken various measures to combat this issue of keeping an area clean by fining people for littering in public spaces and banning defecation in open spaces. The school also has rules regarding cleanliness and certain punishments for littering. However, I feel that these don&#8217;t seem as useful because the job of cleaning up has been left to the custodians, both in school and in these public spaces. It is a state of sorry to see people twice our age cleaning up after the future citizens of a country. It is important for us, as students to start realizing that cleanliness of a space is not a job that we should be pushing onto other people, but something we should be doing as a personal responsibility as good citizens.</p>
<p>It is important that each of us as citizens do our part in maintaining the cleanliness of our surroundings. It can be as simple as picking up any piece of paper we drop or making sure that the things we are throwing away are inside the wastebaskets. These small steps can have a large impact, so to all of us, I say it is time for us to stop thinking of the idea of cleanliness and start doing what we can to make a clean and healthy environment a reality. Thank you.<br />
OR<br />
STRAY DOGS SHOULD NOT BE PUT TO SLEEP</p>
<p>Honourable judges, teachers and my worthy opponents. A very good morning to all of you gathered here. Today, I am glad to have the opportunity to speak for the topic &#8220;Stray Dogs Should Not Be Put To Sleep&#8221;. This topic is one that can be emotional to many. I shall be focusing on both the emotional and factual aspects of this topic.</p>
<p>The saying &#8220;a dog is man&#8217;s best friend&#8221; has been around for centuries. For years, we have taken care of them and they have been nothing but loyal to us. They don&#8217;t demand much from us except for love and attention. The stray dogs that roam in the streets should be seen from another point of view they are as the dogs that have not had the love and care that animals need to survive. Their aggressiveness comes from a place of fear for those who have hurt them, thrown stones at them and yelled at them multiple times. Had people seen these vulnerable creatures and shown them affection and care, then they would not need to be treated in such a harsh manner. Studies have shown that most stray dogs have lesser health problems and are friendlier when given love and attention. Maintaining these breeds who are well-adjusted to the Indian climate is less costly than getting a costly breed. I believe that the issue of having strays on the roads could have been tackled with a little love and care. They wouldn&#8217;t have been strays in the first place if we were more accommodating to this breed. So, extermination is not the right solution. Instead, we should spread awareness about these beautiful God&#8217;s creation and encourage people to adopt them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I would like to point out that putting down animals that have never had the opportunity to be loved as they should have because of decisions made by humans, is a selfish act.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Abundance of advertisements in newspapers, magazines and even on television is a wastage of both time and money of readers and viewers. You are Shobha/Sameer. Write an article in 150 &#8211; 200 words on the topic, &#8216;Excessive Use of Advertisements in Media&#8217;. [10]<br />

Answer:<br />
EXCESSIVE USE OF ADVERTISEMENTS IN MEDIA</p>
<p>By Shobha/Sameer, XIIA<br />
Mark Twain once said, &#8220;Many a small thing has been made large by the right kind of advertising&#8221;. Today&#8217;s media platforms contain more ads than the content itself and this applies to all form of media that we choose to entertain ourselves with. To the media, advertising is more profitable than the content they provide.</p>
<p>Televisions today show more advertisements than the actual content and newspapers contain more ads per page than it does the actual information. Magazines are even more confusing, often giving articles that serve no purpose other than to convince the reader to buy the product advertised on the next page. These advertisements waste the money of those who have subscribed to the product or service for the sake of information. Furthermore, it is statistically shown that the advertisements make people believe that they are missing out on trends leading to excessive consumerism and materialism.</p>
<p>Taking everything into account, it is important to note that reducing the amount of advertising present in the media might have a positive impact. Perhaps, the space allotted to advertisements can be kept as a percentage of information and content presented in order to ensure that the content takes precedence over the advertisements.<br />

HEALTH CHECK UP CAMP IN A SLUM</p>
<p>By Ruchika/Raunak<br />
Amritsar, March 20XX : A health camp was organised in a slum in Amritsar by the NGO &#8216;Health for All.&#8217; The camp was set up in such a way that each person who opted to get the health checkup first had to register at the counter by giving his name and age. Once the check-up was completed, the people were requested to submit the forms at the registration desk.</p>
<p>Upon registration, the people were required to visit a general physician, a dentist, and an optometrist. Once the available doctors had examined them, the participants were required to get a blood test done. For most people tested, it was a basic work-up of their non-fasting blood sugar and other related tests. However, for those who suffered from other diseases, the doctors made a note of it in the form given to them, requesting specific tests be done to understand the severity of the condition. Financing for additional tests were also covered by the medical laboratories associated with the NGO.</p>
<p>The results of these tests shall be available to the NGO in a few weeks&#8217; time and then the doctors and volunteers will return to the slum to treat or advice as necessary to the participants that require it. It was refreshing to see a huge tum-up for this eye-opening event.</p>

<p>Question 8.<br />

(a) &#8216;Garbage to them is gold.&#8217; Why does the author say so about the ragpickers of Seemapuri?<br />
(b) Which two incidents in Douglas&#8217; early life made him scared of water ?<br />
(c) Why was the crofter so talkative and friendly with the peddler?<br />
(d) &#8220;It ate my face up. It ate me up.&#8221; Who said these words? Why?<br />
(e) Why did Evans not take off his hat when Jackson ordered him to do so?<br />
(f) Why did Zitkala-Sa resist the shingling of her hair?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Rag picking is a means of survival to the ragpickers of Seemapuri. They sell all that they pick from the heap of garbage in exchange for money to meet their needs. At times, they even find currency notes and coins in it. To these ragpickers, garbage is equivalent to treasures of gold.<br />
(b) At the age of three or four, Douglas was knocked down by strong waves of the Yakima river. As a result, Douglas was almost buried Under water, and got breathless. Later, at the age of ten or eleven, he was tossed in the YMCA pool by a senior where he ended up swallowing water. These two incidents played a powerful role in developing Douglas&#8217; aversion to water.<br />
(c) The crofter was a lonely old man living all alone with no family. He craved for a human company. Therefore, when the peddler requested the old man for shelter, the old man, in his generosity and need for someone to talk, welcomed the peddler for supper.<br />
(d) Derry showing his inferiority complex, says these words since he is often singled out by people as an ugly poor boy due to his acid- burnt face. As a result of his injury and the behavior of the people in his community, he looks down upon him self as an outcast.<br />
(e) Evans had long wavy hair and covered it with a hat as after the exam he was going to impersonate Mcleery and escape from the prison. Mcleery had short hair so Evans had cropped up his hair and did it under the hat. He confided in Jackson that the hat was the only lucky charm that had brought him luck in his life and so refused to take off his hat.<br />
(f) Zitkala-Sa had learned from her mother that hair shingling was done only to unskilled captured warriors by the enemy. In her family, short hair was considered to be a sign of mourning and cowardice.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Answer any one of the following questions in 120 -150 words : [6]<br />
(a) Everybody during the last lesson was filled with regret. Comment.<br />
(b) Why is the Champaran episode considered to be the beginning of the Indian struggle for independence?<br />
(c) It is not unusual for a lower middle class girl to dream big. How unrealistic were Sophie&#8217;s dreams?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The story, &#8220;The Last Lesson&#8221; is set during the Franco-Prussian War when the French districts of Alsace and Lorraine passed into the hands of Prussia. The Prussian government then made the declaration that only German was to be taught in the schools in Alsace and Lorraine. This order affected the local public badly and each one of them was repenting for wasting time and not learning French. Each person in the class was filled with regret. The French language teacher, M. Hamel felt guilty for sending his students to complete his personal tasks. The parents of the students never bothered to send their children to class but instead preferred that the children work on the farm or at mills. Even the older people in the room like old Hauser, the former mayor, the former postman and other elders of the village showed regret on neither learning French themselves nor encouraging their children to learn the language.</p>
<p>(b) India was under the suzerainty of the British power for more than a hundred years before the incident at Champaran. The people of India were tired of the unjust rules and policies of the British. The landlords at Champaran were forced to grow indigo in 15% of the available land and then surrender the entire harvest as rent. When the peasants learned about the development of synthetic indigo, they demanded for their money. Gandhiji managed to get the amount back and provided courage to the peasants. The incident at Champaran was an attempt to alleviate the distress of large numbers of poor people. At Champaran, Gandhiji received the support of thousands of people. The peasants became aware of their rights, grew more courageous and began to contribute to the movement. Gandhiji successfully implemented the method of non-violence and non-cooperation. Therefore, it can be said that the Champaran episode is the beginning of the Indian struggle for independence.</p>
<p>(c) Sophie the protagonist of the story &#8220;Going Places&#8221; comes from a lower middle-class background and like most girls, she tends to have escapist tendencies. Her background limits her aims and ambitions. Comparatively, her best friend Jansie and her family try to limit her from day dreaming. Sophie dreams of things that she cannot have like buying a boutique. When questioned about how she would go about achieving this dream, she mentions that she would do that through a manager job like Mary Quant or by being an actress, or a fashion designer. She constantly dreams of upgrading her life despite the unrealistic demands of her dreams. The sad reality is that these unrealistic dreams simply distract a person from their goals. It makes a person crave for excuses and separates them from the realities of the world. Sophie&#8217;s dreams and ambitions coupled with her crush on Daney Casey are so unrealistic that they separate her from the realities of her world.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Answer any one of the following questions in 120-150 words: [6]<br />
(a) Describe the efforts made by the Tiger King to achieve his target of killing a hundred tigers.<br />
(b) Explain the reaction of Dr. Sadao&#8217;s servants when he decided to give shelter to an enemy in the house.<br />
(c) Describe Jack&#8217;s art of storytelling.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The Maharaja of Pratibandapuram was known as the Tiger King. At the time of his birth, the astrologers had declared that the prince would die one day. At that prophecy, the ten-day-old prince asked the astrologers to reveal the manner of his death. The wise men, though baffled by this miracle, declared that the prince&#8217;s death would come from a tiger. When the Prince came of age, he took matters in his own hands and killed a tiger. On sharing these details with the astrologer, he stated that it did not mean that the King was safe. As a matter of fact, he must be careful about the hundredth tiger. Thereafter, the King decided to kill a hundred tigers. He, thus, got the name &#8216;Tiger King&#8217;. In his initial years as a king, he killed around seventy tigers. He also killed around twenty-nine tigers in the forest belonging to his father-in-law. Somehow a hundredth tiger was arranged for him to kill but the tiger did not die when it was shot. Later, the soldiers killed the tiger and with this, the King achieved his dream of killing a hundred tigers.</p>
<p>(b) Dr Sadao Hoki resided along the coast in Japan with his wife Hana. During the war, he was not sent along with the other troupes because the General was under his treatment and needed Dr Sadao&#8217;s services. On one occasion, Dr Sadao saw an injured young American soldier in need of his help. He brought the soldier home and began treating him. The servants were frightened and puzzled. As a matter of fact, the old gardener declared that Dr Sadao ought not to heal the wound of that white man because he should have been dead also as he was their enemy. He also believed that the soldier was first shot and then the sea caught him and wounded him with her rocks. If Dr Sadao healed what the shot and the sea had done, then Dr Sadao and the servants would have to suffer. They were also skeptical because the man was their enemy and if the news of the man at the house spread, then their lives would be in danger. The servants finally chose to leave the house altogether.</p>
<p>(c) Storytelling is a ritual for Jack and his four-year-old daughter Jo. He aims to express his wisdom, art and creativity infused with cunningness through his stories. Jack begins his story telling sessions in the evenings and before Saturday naps. The originality of these stories are that they all revolve around a tiny creature called Roger. His stories more or less follow one pattern with minor variations depending on the theme for the day. Each story begins and describes a Roger who may be a squirrel, a fish or a chipmunk. The stories also have a wise owl and a magic wand wielding wizard. Each story is a lesson in morals. Jack successfully manages to capture the attention of his daughter because he understands her span of attention while using his creativity to create the desired effect. He can imitate different voices and uses this positive attribute to communicate his ideas in an enthusiastic manner. Each of these stories are his own invention and he uses this talent along with his other talent of adopting the right facial expressions to capture his daughter&#8217;s interest and provide life lessons along the way.</p>

<p>Question 4.<br />
The elderly living alone in cities are not safe. Reports of violence against them are really very disturbing. The recent murder of two elderly persons has rocked the city. It seems the police are not taking adequate steps to make the elderly feel safe and secure. Write a letter in 120-150 words to the Editor, &#8216;Modern Times&#8217; to draw the attention of the law and order authorities to the problem and take effective steps to deal it.

Sir/Madam,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I, on behalf of the residents of Roshan Colony, wish to bring to your kind attention, the murder of the two elderly people that have taken place recently. As a resident of the area in which the attack took place, I write to point out the lack of protection that the seniors are offered.<br />
The recent murders, while brutal, are not a surprising phenomenon considering the lack of proper precautions taken to ensure the safety of the elderly. While I mourn the loss of the two souls that were attacked, I also fear for those who are still with us. It is even more surprising to see that despite these attacks, very little is done to ensure their safety. It is important, in today&#8217;s times that the authorities take proper precaution for those in our communities who are the most vulnerable i.e., the elderly.<br />
I believe that highlighting it through your newspaper would bring it to the attention of the proper authorities so that they can take appropriate and legal steps to ensure the safety of the elderly at the earliest.<br />
Thanking you,<br />

<p>Question 5.<br />
Career conscious students focus primarily on academics and neglect participation in games and sports, not realising how important physical activities are. You are Vineet/Vinita. Prepare a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly of your school on the topic, &#8216;Balancing Academics and Sports/ [10]<br />
OR<br />
Write a debate in 150-200 words either for or against the motion: 21<sup>st</sup> century is an age of greed&#8217;.<br />
Answer:<br />
BALANCING ACADEMICS AND SPORTS<br />
Dear audience, Good morning to all. I, Vineet/ Vinita, feel extremely happy as it&#8217;s a matter of great privilege for me to deliver a speech on the topic, &#8220;Balancing Academics and Sports&#8221;.<br />
Today is a beautiful day for playing outside, and yet, many of our students and my fellow classmates, will skip the chance to play in favour of another round of revision of our study materials. This is done in hopes of improving their scores and having a better career, a better future. However, in doing so, they are ignoring one very important factor that is essential for a successful future i.e., health.</p>
<p>While pulling away from the books to play or participate in sports for a while might sound like a huge sacrifice, it is a necessity. Finding a balance between sports and academics ensures success in the future. It has been proven that our brain cannot process all the information given to it without breaks. Sports and other physical activities help our brain process things faster. Focusing solely on academics leads to anxiety, distress and depression in students.<br />
I would like to conclude this speech by saying that health is something to be treasured, we can never regain it if lost. Hence, Sports should be an integral part of the curriculum. Focusing all our energy on academics at such a crucial age can have a huge effect that can change our lives. Thanks to all for being so generous in listening to my views so attentively and patiently.<br />
OR<br />
21<sup>ST</sup> CENTURY IS AN AGE OF GREED<br />
Respected chairperson, members of the jury and my worthy opponents, I, xyz of class XII am glad to have the opportunity today to argue against the motion that &#8220;21st Century is an age of greed&#8221;.</p>
<p>The notion that the 21st century is full of greed is one that is easy to arrive at. Today we have more material comfort than we probably know what to do with and a great divide in the incomes that people earn. Yet, we are in a time when more people are giving to charity than ever before. In the past few years, those who can, have started donating generously to multiple causes. There exist NGO&#8217;s and charities that help people with everything from getting back onto their feet after a natural disaster to curing terminal illnesses. What is important to note is not just that these charities exist, but that there is an increasing number of people giving generously towards various causes. As a matter of fact, social media has played an important role in encouraging people to donate to the right medium.</p>
<p>To conclude, I would like to point out that while there is an increasing number of products, technological advances and services people are paying for, there is a balanced increase in the amount that people are giving to those in need. Thank You!</p>

Question 8.<br />
Answer any four of the following questions in 30 &#8211; 40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]<br />
(a) What are the two most admirable qualities in Mukesh ?<br />
(b) What is wrong with Jansie&#8217;s outlook on life?<br />
(c) What does Neruda wish fishermen and warmongers to do ?<br />
(d) How is the Derry we meet at the beginning different from the Derry at the end ?<br />
(e) Why was the General apologetic when Sadao told him that the prisoner had escaped?<br />
(f) Why did Zitkala-Sa oppose tooth and nail the shingling of her long hair ?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Two admirable qualities in Mukesh are that he dares to dream and is focused on achieving them. Mukesh refuses to accept his destiny as a bangle-maker like his father and ancestors. He is ready to walk the long distance from his house to the garage where could learn to be a motor mechanic which he aims to be.<br />
(b) Jansie is too pragmatic towards how she percieves things to be. She is not flexible about her dreams and believes that she will continue to be in the position that they currently live in Jansie is realistic and constantly keeps Sophie&#8217;s day-dreaming in check.<br />
(c) Neruda is a lover of peace and non-violence. He wishes that the fishermen do not hunt the whales in the cold regions. He also wishes that the warmongers who normally indulge in wars and violence, walk with their brothers in some of their best clothes in the shade of trees, doing nothing.<br />
(d) Derry at the beginning of the story is a very negative person and because of his ugly appearance, hides away from the crowds. He believes that the acid has eaten his skin and him alive. He feels that he doesn&#8217;t need any second chance to live. However, Derry at the end of the story is more optimistic and practical. He decides to live happily by being friendlier with people.<br />
(e) The General believed that Sadao was indispensable to his life as none were as skilled as Dr Sadao. When Sadao told him about the prisoner who had escaped, he was apologetic as he had forgotten about his promise of sending assassins to kill the enemy, that he made to Sadao, in his greed and selfish needs.<br />
(f) Zitkala-Sa opposed tooth and nail the shingling of her long hair because she remembered her mother&#8217;s words. Her mother told her that shingling of the hair was done to the prisoners of the war. In their culture, only mourners and cowards kept short hair.</p>

<p>Question 5.<br />
Respect for law, concern for others and maintaining a clean environment are some of the qualities of a civilized person. It is sad that we do not pay much attention to them. You are Shoma/Sonu. Write a speech in 150-200 words to be delivered in the morning assembly on the topic, &#8216;Importance of Civic Sense&#8217;. [10]<br />
OR<br />
Write a debate in 150-200 words either for or against the motion:<br />
&#8216;Money is the only thing that matters in today&#8217;s life&#8217;.<br />
Answer:<br />
IMPORTANCE OF CIVIC SENSE<br />
Dear Friends and Faculty, I, Shoma/Sonu of class XII-C, wish all of you a very good Morning. I am privileged to present my views on the importance of civic sense with you today.</p>
<p>How often have we seen people spitting on the roadside? How often have we seen people standing, watching someone else in pain? How many of us leave the lights on when we don&#8217;t really need it?</p>
<p>We see these things on a daily basis. We curse the people who do these things but then we do it ourselves too. We say to ourselves, &#8220;Why should I stop when no one else is?&#8221; We forget that every single person&#8217;s actions matter.</p>
<p>We live in a time where we stand at the edge of irreversible changes. In such a time, it becomes more important than ever that we hold on to our civic sense. If we continue to live as individuals rather than a society on this planet, just functioning based on rules that ensure our mere survival, then there will come a time when the society will never be the same. Knowing this, it becomes even more important to emphasize the importance that civic sense can have in our very lives. It is high time that we all start to live with civic sense and social mannerism for a cleaner and healthier environment. This will help us change the society at the earliest.<br />
Thank you.<br />
OR</p>
<p>MONEY IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS IN TODAY&#8217;S LIFE</p>
<p>Honourable judges, teachers and my worthy opponents, today, I am glad to receive this opportunity to present to you my side for the argument &#8220;Money is the only thing that matters in today&#8217;s life&#8221;.</p>
<p>In today&#8217;s society, having money can be the difference between life and death. It has become common knowledge to know that one can get anywhere if the right people are on your side. The way our society is built, the value placed on money and having more of it has lead to the rise of Billionaires with so much wealth that they no longer are in touch with how the common man survives and in the same place, we have people who cannot access basic necessities because of the lack of funds.</p>
<p>This disparity does not reduce as time goes on, it grows. This is because access to good education, high-paying jobs and better accommodations are available only to those who have the money to afford it. While it is easy to say that the younger generations place less importance on money, it is only those with money that can say this. Without money, one cannot get anywhere in today&#8217;s society. At the end of the day, one can&#8217;t help but agree that money moves the world around .</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
The tendency to use violence at the slightest provocation and thus to solve personal and general problems is growing among people in our society. This is not a civilized way of dealing with the problems. Violence solves no problem; it must be shunned. Write a article in 150-200 words on the topic, You are Shan/ Shobha. [10]<br />
OR<br />
The Fine Arts Club of your school celebrated its tenth anniversary in a grand manner. Distinguished artists Pt. Jasraj, Hariprasad Chaurasia and the veteran Kathak dancer Shovana Narayan graced the occasion and enthralled the audience by their mesmerizing compositions. Shovana Narayan&#8217;s graceful movements were a delight to watch. The function ended with two lilting songs by Shambu, a class 10<sup>th</sup> student of your school. Write a report in 150-200 words on the event, to be published in your school magazine. You are Sohan/Sakhi, Secretary of the Club.<br />
Answer:<br />
&#8216;DON&#8217;T TAKE LAW INTO YOUR OWN HANDS.</p>
<p>By Shobha / Shan<br />
&#8220;An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.&#8221; This was stated by Mahatma Gandhi when our nation was fighting for its independence from the British Raj. Yet, today our nation faces the growing problem of violence at the slightest provocation.</p>
<p>All it takes for a violent attack on another person is their presence. Women have been attacked for working at officer or studying in colleges because others believe they do not have the right to be there, people of different race or colour are abused and attacked verbally or physically simply for existing in a certain space. The tendency to hate is strong. There is a growing crowd of both victims and perpetrators and sometimes one can&#8217;t help but wonder if the need to rely on the laws of the land is indeed worthwhile.</p>
<p>Sadly, taking matters into ones hands are not the methods through which problems are truly solved. All violence does is to breed more violence. It is important to take steps to help people find the right way to solve problems, through the use of words over actions. This can only be done if there are proper precautions in place for people who act out aggressively with the barest hint of provocation. It is time that we, as a society, look at the problem of violence more seriously and try to find a solution together.<br />

10<sup>th</sup> ANNIVERSARY OF THE FINE ARTS CLUB</p>
<p>By Sakhi / Sohan, Secretary of Fine Arts Club Last Friday marked the tenth anniversary of our school&#8217;s Fine Arts Club. To commemorate this achievement, a grand celebration was held to honour the milestones achieved by the club. The celebration, lasting nearly an entire day, included a variety of renowned artists and veterans of the business as well as performances by the club members. Held at the School Auditorium, the Club is proud to say that the entire hall was full of guests as well as audiences. Aside from the notable faces, the crowd also held parents of the club members as well as outsiders who had bought tickets to attend the event.</p>
<p>The audience was treated by performances of the distinguished artists such as Pt. Jasraj and Hariprasad Chaurasia. Their performances captivated the audience and their compositions moved the audience changing the air of the entire celebration. We were also graced with the veteran Kathak dancer Shovana Narayan who gave us the honour of performing on the stage. In grand finale of the show, there was two songs performed by Shambu, a class 10 student and a club member. The talented and heart-wrenching performance earned a standing ovation from the audience and there were requests for an encore, which we were unable to perform due to time constraints. The President of the club presented the vote of thanks after which light refreshments were served.</p>
<p><strong>SECTION &#8211; C</strong></p>
<p>(LITERATURE : TEXTBOOKS AND LONG READING TEXT)</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Answer any four of the following questions in 30 &#8211; 40 words each: [3 × 4 = 12]<br />
(a) What steps did Gandhiji take to remove the cultural and social backwardness in the rural areas of Champaran ?<br />
(b) Why was the crofter so kind and generous to the peddler ?<br />
(c) Give examples from &#8216;Keeping Quiet&#8217; to show that Neruda was peace loving.<br />
(d) How did Annan&#8217;s advice to his sister Bama impact her ?<br />
(e) What dilemma did Sadao and his wife face when they saw the wounded American soldier ?<br />
(f) How did Jo want the story narrated by her father to end ?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The social and cultural backwardness in the rural areas of Champaran caused Gandhi a great pain. His appeal for teachers was responded by several people. In about six villages, primary schools were opened. Gandhi&#8217;s wife and youngest son also came to Champaran to help him. Kasturba taught personal cleanliness and community sanitation to the people. Gandhi also managed to get the help of a doctor who with three medicines, tried to fight the miserable health conditions of Champaran.</p>
<p>(b) The crofter was a lonely old man living all alone with no family. He craved for a human company. Therefore, when the peddler requested the old man for a shelter the old man, in his generosity and need for someone to talk, welcomed the peddler for supper.</p>
<p>(c) We know that the poet Neruda is a peace-loving person through several instances in the poem. He cares for both humans and nature. In the poem, Neruda wishes that fishermen do not hunt whales, he wants the man who is collecting salt to stop for a while and see the self-harm it is doing and lastly, he wishes that people who run about indulging in wars, to stop what they are doing and instead, embrace peace with their brothers.</p>
<p>(d) Annan told his sister Bama that they were born into the untouchable caste and they did not have any honor or dignity. The only way to earn their due respect was to go ahead in life by studying hard. These words changed Bama&#8217;s attitude towards life. She took her brother Annan&#8217;s advice seriously and excelled in her academics. She stood first in her class and this gained her the respect of people as well as friends.</p>
<p>(e) Dr. Sadao and his wife found the wounded American soldier on the beach near their house. The soldier needed an immediate medical attention which Dr.Sadao could give. If Dr. Sadao sheltered the American soldier, they could be arrested. However, if they handed the soldier to the police he would surely die. Thus, Dr. Sadao was in a dilemma.</p>
<p>(f) The story narrated by Jo&#8217;s father ended with Roger the skunk&#8217;s mother hitting the wizard for making her son smell like roses. Jo did not like this ending. She wanted the wizard to hit Roger&#8217;s mother back for not letting his</p>
