<p>Question 11.<br />
What is hyperinflation ? What were the factors that led to hyperinflation in Germany ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Hyperinflation is a situation when prices rise phenomenally high. This situation occurred in Germany in 1932 due to following reasons :</p>

<li>In 1923 Germany refused to pay, and the French occupied its leading industrial area, Ruhr, to claim their coal. Germany retaliated with passive resistance and printed paper currency recklessly. With too much printed money in circulation, the value of the German mark fell.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 12.<br />
Explain the factors which led to the rise of Hitler in Germany.<br />
Answer:<br />
The factors which led to the rise of Hitler in Germany were :</p>
<ul>
<li>Germany was compelled to sign the treaty by which she had to pay a huge war indemnity. This treaty created the feeling of dissatisfaction among the people of Germany. The Weimar Republic was regarded as a symbol of national disgrace. Hitler assured the Germans about the restoration of the old prestige, so they became his followers.</li>
<li>Germany had to face a Great Economic crisis after the First World War. Many soldiers were no more in service, so they became unemployed. Trade and commerce were ruined. In 1929, there was, however, a great slump in Europe. Germany was in the grip of unemployment and starvation. The prices rose and the value of money fell.</li>
<li>The Germans had no faith in democracy. It was against their culture and tradition. They, at once, gave support to a strong man of action like Hitler who could turn their dreams into reality.</li>

<li>All political parties and trade unions were banned except for the Nazi Party and its affiliates. The state established complete control over the economy, media, army and judiciary.</li>
<li>Special surveillance and security forces were created to control and order society in ways that the Nazis wanted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 14.<br />
What promises did Hitler make to the German people ? How did he mobilise them ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Hitler was a powerful speaker. His passion and his words moved people. He promised to build a strong nation, undo the injustice of the Versailles Treaty and restore the dignity of the German people.</p>
<p>He promised employment for those looking for work, and a secure future for the youth. He promised to weed out all foreign influences and resist all foreign ‘conspiracies’ against Germany.</p>
<p>Hitler devised a new style of politics. He understood the significance of rituals and spectacle in mass mobilisation. Nazis held massive rallies and public meetings to demonstrate the support for Hitler and instil a sense of unity among the people. The Red banners with the Swastika, the Nazi salute, and the ritualised rounds of applause after the speeches were all part of this spectacle of power.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
From whom did Hitler borrow his racist ideology ? Explain.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Hitler borrowed his racist ideology from thinkers like Charles Darwin and Herbert Spencer.<br />
(b) Darwin was a natural scientist who tried to explain the creation of plants and • animals through the concept of evolution and natural selection. Darwin never<br />
advocated human intervention in what he thought was a purely natural process of selection.<br />
(c) Herbert Spencer later added the idea of survival of the fittest. According to this idea, only those species survived on earth that could adapt themselves to changing climatic conditions.<br />
However, his ideas were used by racist thinkers and politicians to justify imperial rule over conquered peoples.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />

<li>The number of unemployed touched an unprecedented 6 million. Men could be seen on streets with placards saying,’ Willing to do any work’. As jobs disappeared, youth took to criminal activities, and total despair became common place.</li>
<li>There were deep anxieties and fears in people. The middle classes, especially salaried employees and pensioners, saw their savings diminish when the currency lost its value.</li>
<li>The large mass of peasantry was badly affected by a sharp fall in agricultural prices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 17.<br />
‘In my state the mother is the most important citizen.’ Discuss this statement made by Hitler.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Though Hitler said that in my state the mother is the most important citizen, it was not true.<br />
(b) All mothers were not treated equally. Women who bore racially desirable children were awarded, while those who bore racially undesirable children were punished.<br />

<h3>Nazims and The Rise of Hitler Class 9 Extra Questions Long Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What steps were taken by Adolf Hitler for the destruction of democracy ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The following steps were taken by Hitler for the destruction of democracy :</p>
<ul>
<li>A mysterious fire that broke out in the German Parliament building in February, 1933 indefinitely suspended civic rights. It is said that the fire was broken out by Hitler’s supporters, while Hitler blamed his political enemies for it. The Fire Decree of 28 February, 1933 indefinitely suspended civic rights such as freedom of expression, speech, press and assembly that had been guaranteed by the Weimar Constitution.</li>
<li>After that Adolf Hitler turned on his enemy, i.e., the Communists of Germany, most &#8216; of the communists were quickly packed off to the newly established concentration camps.</li>
<li>The repression of the Communists was severe. Their membership was in thousands. They were, however, only one among the 52 types of victims persecuted by the Nazis across the country.</li>
<li>On 3rd March, 1933, the famous Enabling Act was passed. This Act established dictatorship in Germany. It gave Adolf Hitler all political and administrative powers to sideline German Parliament and rule by decree.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What were the main effects of Nazi rule on Germany ?<br />
Answer:<br />
The victory of Nazism produced far reaching effects on Germany :</p>
<ul>
<li>Hitler tried to pull his country out of the Economic Crisis that had befallen on Germany as a result of her defeat in the First World War.<br />
Different types of industries were set up to provide work to the workmen. Trade was encouraged with the same aim in mind.</li>
<li>Hitler inspired to make Germany a powerful country and enhanced his military power in all possible ways.</li>
<li>All political parties except the Nazi Party were banned. And, then a Reign of Terror was let loose in Germany. Assassinations of anti-Nazi leaders took place on a large scale.</li>
<li>The Communist Parties were also banned.</li>
<li>Trade unions were suppressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />

<p>He then went on to wrest German speaking Sudentenland from Czechoslovakia and gobbled up the entire country. In all of this he had the unspoken support of England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh. These quick successes at home and abroad seemed to reverse the destiny of the country.</p>
<p>Hitler chose war as the way out of the approaching economic crisis. Resources were to be accumulated through expansion of territory. In September 1939, Germany invaded Poland. This started a war with France and England. In September 1940, a Tripartite Pact was signed between Germany, Italy and Japan, strengthening Hitler’s claim to , international power.</p>
<p>Hitler now moved to achieve his long-term aim of conquering Eastern Europe. He wanted to ensure food supplies and living space for Germans. He attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941. In this historic blunder Hitler exposed the German western front to British aerial bombing and the eastern front to the powerful Soviet armies.</p>

Though Germany made initial gains by occupying France and Belgium, the Allies became stronger when the US joined them in 1917 and defeated Germany and the Central Powers.</p>
<p>The defeat of Germany resulted in the abdication of the German Emperor. This gave an opportunity for the parliamentary parties to bring in a change, in German politics.

Answer:<br />
There was some financial stability between 1924 and 1928. Short term loans from the USA helped industrial recovery in Germany. In 1929, when the Wall Street Exchange crushed, the US withdrew all the loans. People rushed in to sell their shares as they thought that the prices would go down drastically. It was said that on the 24<sup>th</sup> October alone about 13 million shares were sold. This brought about the Great Economic Depression.</p>
<p>The national income of the US fell by nearly 50% between 1929 and 1932. The factories were shut down, exports fell, farmers were affected badly and the speculators withdrew their money from the market. All these affected not only the US but the entire world.</p>

<p>He then captured the German-speaking Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia, and soon gobbled up the entire country.<br />
In all of his foreign activities Hitler had the unspoken support of England, which had considered the Versailles verdict too harsh. These quick successes Hitler had at home and abroad reversed the destiny of the country.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
What was the historic blunder Hitler committed in 1941?<br />
Answer:<br />

A large majority of Germans were passive onlookers and were scared to differ or protest.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />

<p>Question 14.<br />
Why did the Nazis hate the Jews?<br />
Answer:<br />
Traditionally the Jews were considered as the killers of Jesus Christ. It was this traditional hostility and the fact that were basically money lenders charging excessive interest that made the Nazis hate the Jews.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
Why did the German Mark collapse?<br />
Answer:<br />
Germany had to pay war reparation after its defeat in the First World War. But Germany refused to pay the reparation and France occupied Ruhr to claim Germany’s coal.
