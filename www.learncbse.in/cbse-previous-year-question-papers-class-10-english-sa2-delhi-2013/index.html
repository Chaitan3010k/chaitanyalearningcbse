<strong>Question.1. Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
<strong> We sat in silence in the dark of the night as the large head appeared from the large foliage. The female ,was young, healthy and alert. Seconds later, she walked confidently to the edge of a waterhole followed by not one, not two, but three beautiful young cubs. Like works of art on display, all four tigers bent low at the waterhole that had been created for them and for the myriad creatures that shared their troubled kingdom. The Goshri tigers had come visiting and we watched them with rapt attention on our closed-circuit TV screens, in the conservation retreat of Harsh and Poonam Dhanwatey, a husband and wife team whose life had been dedicated to the protection of tigers in and around Maharashtra&#8217;s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. Their son Nikhii carefully positioned the cameras and cabled them 40 metres from their conservation retreat, near the waterhole that had turned into a magnet for every conceivable animal found in the Tiger Reserve itself. We were making preparations to set up one of the first Community Conservation Reserves in Central India. Originally into business, the Dhanwatevs changed tracks midstream by shutting down a thriving interior design business in response to just one meeting they had with Dr. Ullas Karanth and Valmik Thapar, two of India&#8217;s finest tiger people, in Nagpur. In their own words: &#8220;From admirers of wildlife we became passionate defenders and we launched our non-governmental organization called Tiger Research and Conservation Trust (TRACT).&#8221; The Dhanwatevs lived for years in a small hut that was their field camp near the famous Tadoba Lake and they discovered the secrets of the forest in the best way possible, by walking its trails, and generally learning all they could about the magical mix of life that comprised this tropical, dry deciduous forest.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question.2. Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;Mum!&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; I saw her little tent shuddering in the gale and listened closely for her response. Her voice was almost casual: &#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; That&#8217;s my mother. It was the first night of our cycling trip through the interior of Iceland—a region so remote and inhospitable that for centuries, according to legend, it was abandoned. The weather was decidedly hurricane-like, but Mum wasn&#8217;t concerned. Months ago, I told her about my plan to pedal across Iceland. &#8220;It will be really difficult,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The roads are unpaved and often washed out, and the wind is blowing constantly — sometimes so hard that it pushes you off the road.&#8221; There was silence for a moment. Then she asked, &#8220;Can I come?&#8221; &#8220;Sure,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But like the rest of us, you have to train to do two 160 kilo metres a day back-to-back,&#8221; &#8220;Wow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I could never do that.&#8221; I had more faith in my mother&#8217;s physical abilities than she did. I&#8217;d seen her raise six children and put in long hours doing physical labour on our small farm. &#8220;Sure you can,&#8221; I told her, &#8220;Start tomorrow.&#8221; What really concerned me was what 1 perceived to be her frustrating humility: I thought her too self-depreciating about her intellect just because she had not completed college. 1 felt she underestimated her attractiveness just because she was not the type to wear makeup or fancy clothes. As I had grown into adulthood, the life I&#8217;d chosen seemed light-years away from Mum&#8217;s quiet existence, still caring for her children and her children&#8217;s children. Sometimes, on a visit home, I&#8217;d describe some recent trip I&#8217;d taken, and her blue eyes would shine with interest. So I couldn&#8217;t help thinking this trek might revitalize Mum, who had started to slow down in her 50s. It might spice up what I saw as her humdrum life. And it might be a boost to her tentative and retiring persona. Mum trained furiously, months in advance. As the trip roster was pared down to Mum, my good friend Allen and me, she stood as the most dedicated. Soon she was riding 80-100 kilo metres per day, and was as strong a rider as Allen or I.</strong></p>

XYZ City The Editor The Times Delhi<br />
22nd October, 20xx Sir<br />
Through the medium of this letter I would like to express my anxiety about the roaming of stray animals on the road especially during the busy traffic hours.<br />
These stray animals that keep roaming on the roads also cause injury to people besides blocking traffic. Last week there was news of stray dogs and even monkeys biting people. and a young man was even attacked by a stray bull. More often than not we have seen stray cows and donkeys blocking the traffic. I am sure you too have witnessed this menace. These stray animals also cause unhygienic conditions in the city by strewing the waste of garbage dumps all over. The urgent need of the hour is to stop this growing menace. Strict action should be taken against owners who allow their animals to go astray. Animal shelters should be built to provide a shelter for these stray animals. Moreover public awareness has to be created as to whom people should contact if they see stray animals on the road. If these simple steps are taken we will gradually see the number of stray animals decreasing and a great deal of our inconvenience will be reduced.<br />
I sincerely hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that the nuisance created by stray animals can at least be minimized.<br />
Yours Sincerely,<br />
Kriti<br />

Incredibly Unsafe India<br />
By: XYZ<br />
Despite the grand scale at which &#8216;Incredible India&#8217; campaign has been pitched, the issue of safety and security of tourists visiting India is of vital concern. There have been regular reports of women tourists being robbed, raped and even killed. There are people who pass themselves off as tourist guides but they are actually out to cause harm to vulnerable women tourists. The police should ensure that the touts, guides and others who come into contact with tourists are screened and questioned. It is high time our tourism ministry realized just how grave the situation is and take up realistic and effective steps to cleanse tourist destinations. It is not an impossible task, it only requires the determination and willingness to work together. Knee jerk reactions will not serve any purpose. Catchy slogans like &#8216;Incredible India&#8217; will only appear grotesque if firm steps are not taken up to give tourist spots in India a new and safe image. Tourism is a very important industry that fetches our country foreign revenue and the image of our country greatly depends on the tourists&#8217; experience because &#8216;word of mouth&#8217; is the best form of publicity.</p>
<p><strong>Question.4. Develop the following into a readable story in 150-200 words.</strong><br />

<strong> Answer.</strong>It was dark, when we got down from the train. The place was totally strange to us. Gopi who had promised to be at the station was nowhere in sight We got off the train with a lot of apprehension and anxiety. It was dark and stormy and it was just the three of us, nineteen year old lads. Our friend Gopi who was to receive us at the station was not there. We tried to contact Gopi on his mobile but it was not reachable. As we were deciding what to do next, a young boy of almost our age approached us and offered to help us. At first we were apprehensive to take his help but soon realized we had no choice but to follow him. He led us out of the station into a waiting taxi. We thought the taxi driver looked suspicious but he assured us and as soon as we were seated in the taxi, the driver shot his taxi off like a bullet. We told him to go slow but he would not listen. We wanted him to stop but he did not. He took us to a deserted area and there he halted the taxi. We got off mortified and were ready to run for our lives when we heard a familiar voice. It was Gopi in the guise of the driver who had devised this welcome plan for us.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
At the party, Lalitha was thrilled to notice that sitting in a corner all alone, was her friend whom she had not met for a long time she could not believe that her childhood friend Seema was sitting right in front of her. She approached her and decided she would play a guessing game with her. After a casual greeting, Lalitha asked her to guess who she was. Seema looked a little baffled and confused and was unable to place Lalitha, Lalitha then reminded her of some childhood pranks that they had played together. Seema looked amused but she was still not able to recognize Lalitha. It was only when Lalitha called out Seema&#8217;s name in an exasperated tone that the latter burst out laughing. She jumped in excitement and hugged Lalitha. The boring party suddenly became a memorable experience for the two childhood friends. They chatted like two school-going girls for the next two hours. Soon the party wrapped up but not for them as Lalitha invited Seema to stay with her for the night.</p>

<strong> &#8216;Shall Caesar send a lie?</strong><br />
<strong> Have I in conquest stretch’d mine arm so far,</strong><br />
<strong> To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?</strong><br />

<strong> (b) What message does Caesar give him?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Who are the &#8216;graybeards&#8217; referred to here?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) Michael had thought earlier that Sebastian was a boy who was a part of the game.<br />
(b) Sebastian is called &#8216;the boy from the game&#8217; because he was Michael&#8217;s companion in the psycho-drive game. The real Sebastian and the one in the game were actually one person.<br />
(c) In the newspaper Michael had seen proof of Sebastian&#8217;s existence in real life, the same Sebastian whom Michael had succeeded in saving in the game. He had read a headline in the newspaper which said &#8216;Miracle Recovery.&#8217; According to this article, Sebastian Shultz survived coma that the doctors felt might last forever.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
(a) Decius had come to Caesar&#8217;s palace to fetch him (Caesar) to the senate-house.<br />
(b) Caesar tells him to bear his greetings to the senators and also tell them that he will not come to the senate-house on that day.<br />

<strong> (a) Why had Michael and his father gone to the computer fair?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Why does Lavinia feel that the Ouija board would help her husband?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) How did the mariners reach the land of ice and snow?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) How does Brutus convince the Romans that Caesar deserved his death?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why does the poet decide to stand and wait till the snake has finished drinking? What</strong><br />
<strong> does this tell you about the poet?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> (a) Michael&#8217;s father was crazy about computers. Technology was advancing every day<br />
and his father could not resist any of the new gadgets and mechanical devices that came on the market. He had bought the latest computer which could do anything: paint, play music, create displays. He had also bought many latest psycho-drive games and a virtual reality visor and glove. That is why both of them had gone to the Computer Fair.<br />
(b) Lavinia feels that the Ouija board would help her husband write his stories. If he wanted to write a historical novel, rather than reading thick history books he would get the Ouija board and talk to the spirit of Napoleon the Great or Helen of Troy and he would directly get all the information he needed.<br />
(c) The sea which had earlier been calm turned tyrannous and wild after a storm and the strong winds forced the ship to sail southwards ultimately leading them to the land of the ice and snow. They were surrounded by large masts of ice and their ship could hardly move in the frozen sea.<br />
(d) Brutus convinces the Romans that Caesar deserved his death. Brutus justifies Caesar&#8217;s assassination by telling the Roman citizens that Caesar had become overambitious and had started placing his own interest before that of the country. He did not want the Romans to live the life of slaves under an autocratic ruler like Caesar.<br />
(e) Since the snake had come to the water-trough before the poet he decided to stand and wait till the snake had finished drinking. Treating the snake as an equal and an early arriver at the water trough, the poet is content to wait as a &#8216;second-comer&#8217;. This act of the poet tells us that the poet respects the right of existence of all creatures who have as much a right to enjoy nature&#8217;s resources as much as he has.</p>

I hope my letter finds you and your family in good health and great spirits. You will be happy to know that I have been selected as the General Manager of my company from among twenty aspiring candidates.<br />
I feel my selection just proves that the value of hard work and the art of putting in your best is never wasted. Hard work is challenging but rewarding. To succeed in life you need to put in your best. A person can excel in any. field by his hard work. If a person has the ability to work<br />
hard he possesses a great quality because it is the key to success. All great men of the world were diligent and hardworking. Hard work also makes us better prepared to face adverse situations.<br />
I can go on and on about the value of hard work but I shall wait till the time we meet to discuss this topic further. Give my regards to all elders and love to the children.<br />

Dearest Sister,<br />
I hope my letter finds you and your family in good health. You will be shocked and somewhat amused to know about an incident that caused a great misunderstanding between John and me.<br />
I know you must be wondering about this undue delay in writing to you but I am sure after reading what I have been through you will understand the reason for this delay. My relationship with John had almost been on the verge of breaking up due to a terrible misunderstanding and lack of trust but fortunately we are now over that worst phase of our life. I am sure you will be all the more puzzled when I tell you that a ghost would have been responsible if we had drifted apart. An Ouija board that I brought home revealed that someone by the name of Helen had been communicating with John and I foolishly suspected John of seeing another women. I had even decided to leave him as I felt John too was behaving rather suspiciously. But it was actually a ghost by the name of Helen who had been communicating with John. I felt very embarrassed and miserable at my immature reaction and immediately apologised to John. My loving husband forgave me instantly and we are together again. I promise to never to lose faith in our relationship.<br />
I know it was extremely silly of me to lose trust on my .husband and suspect him of having an affair but, I guess, love makes you extremely possessive. Do write to me soon. Awaiting your letter.<br />
Yours lovingly ,<br />

<p><strong>Question.11A. When Anne told her father about Peter and herself, what was his reaction? Did she take his words kindly? Support your answer with examples from her diary entries of May 1944.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> What light do the diary entries of Anne throw on the character of Mr. Dussel?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong>Anne&#8217;s relationship with Peter intensifies and she spends all her time with him. Her father disapproves of this. Anne takes Margot&#8217;s advice to write a letter to her father about her thoughts and feelings about Peter. Anne writes a letter to her father telling him how she has struggled bitterly and can now live without being responsible to anyone. Her letter upsets her father. He tells him her loving parents did not deserve such a reproach. Anne feels guilty for being so harsh, and her pride is wounded, for she has been taken off the pedestal where she could do no wrong or hurt anyone. She is ashamed of herself and realizes that she still has a lot to learn.<br />
Or<br />
Anne gives a very negative portrayal of Mr. Dussel. He is an ill-tempered old dentist and Anne&#8217;s roommate in the Secret Annex. He does not respect Anne at all and demands her cooperation with all of his absurd wishes, never taking Anne&#8217;s own feelings and desires into consideration. He is basically a selfish man, never grateful to the Franks or Van Daans for sharing their hiding place with him, never showing any kind of gratitude to his protectors. He frequently endangers the other members of the Secret Annex by breaking their security rules and hoards food, which he refuses to share. He fights with everyone in the Annex and often give them the silent treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Question.11B. &#8220;And even now I sometimes feel the same uneasiness and disquietude.&#8221; Why does Helen speak these words? How did she come out of her uneasiness? </strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Write a character sketch of Bishop Brooks.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong>Helen was devastated by the charges of plagiarism, and by Michael Anagnos&#8217; efforts to distance himself from her. She feels a sense of &#8220;uneasiness and disquietude&#8221; when she is writing for fear that she plight be plagiarizing someone else&#8217;s words although she was cleared of any wrongdoing. To put this feeling of uneasiness behind her, Helen visits the Niagara Falls where she feels &#8220;the air vibrate and the earth tremble&#8221; and the World Fair, both of which have a positive impact on her and help her to overcome her feeling of disquietude and anxiety.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Bishop Brooks was one of the many men of genius whom Helen met. He was the most inspiring spiritual influence in Helen&#8217;s life. He was a true preacher and a noble soul. Helen considered it her privilege to be acquainted with him and to talk to him. She knew him from her childhood when she used to sit on his lap as he talked about God and spirituality. He was like a father figure to Helen and his lesson inspired her to broaden her love for humanity. He also taught Helen the concept of universal religion and the religion of love. Her closeness to Bishop Brooks taught Helen how to embrace humanity and the lessons taught by him left an indelible impression on Helen&#8217;s heart.</p>

I hope you and your family are in good health and great spirits. We all are doing well.<br />
I am really excited because for the first time I witnessed a film scene being shot that too in my locality. This film which is likely to release after about three months just completed a ten day shooting schedule here. We got a chance to meet and take the autographs of superstars Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.<br />
It was also good a learning experience to see exactly how a film is shot. From the camera, lighting, sound equipment to the vanity vans of the actors, it was fascinating to see how much effort and detail goes into a single shot. Let me tell you it is not an easy task and each minor detail needs to be taken into consideration. I have so much more to tell you about this unique experience but it will have to wait until we meet.<br />
It was surely one of the most exciting days of my life. Give my due regards to your parents and reply soon.<br />

I hope you both are doipg well. You will be happy to know that I have started settling in my new job and in this new city.<br />
Initially I did face a few problems regarding commuting and accommodation but thanks to my colleagues, who have been extremely cooperative, I have overcome all my problems. Infect I am enjoying my new job because the people in my office are very kind and helpful. Hyderabad is a nice city, the people here are also warm and friendly though the language barrier does pose a problem sometimes. But my initial apprehension and anxiety regarding my shift to a new city for a new job is now a thing of the past.<br />
I am really happy with my decision and will remain grateful to both of you for supporting me in my decision.<br />
