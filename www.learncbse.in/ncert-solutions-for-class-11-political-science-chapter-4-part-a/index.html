<h3>Class 11 Political Science Chapter 4 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved</h3>
<p>Questions 1.<br />
A parliamentary executive means:<br />
(а) Executive where there is a parliament<br />
(б) Executive elected by the parliament<br />
(c) Where the parliament functions as the Executive<br />
(d) Executive that is dependent on support of the majority in the parliament<br />
Answer:<br />
(d) Executive that is dependent on support of the majority in the parliament.</p>
<p>Questions 2.<br />
Read this dialogue. Which argument do you agree with? Why?<br />
Amit: Looking at the constitutional provisions, it seems that the President is only a rubber stamp.<br />
Shama: The President appoints the Prime Minister. So, he must have the powers to remove the Prime Minister as well.<br />
Rajesh: We don’t need a President. After the election, the Parliament can meet and elect a leader to be the Prime Minister.<br />
Answer:<br />
We agree with the dialogue of Shama because the office of the President of India is the office of respect and nominal supremacy. He is not only a rubber stamp but he can use his discretionary power at the appointment of the Prime Minister in case of no single party gets majority. The Council of Ministers is answerable to the people. As soon as the council loses the confidence of the lower house it falls automatically. Hence, no need to remove the Prime Minister by the President.</p>

<p>Question 7.<br />
Why do you think is the advice of the Council of Ministers binding on the President? Give your answer in not more than 100 words.<br />

The advice of the Council of Ministers is binding on the President because:</p>
<ul>
<li>The President is the formal head of the government in a parliamentary system.</li>
<li>Article 74(1) states that there will be a council of ministers as a head to aid and advise the President.</li>
<li>President will act in accordance with such advice by the council.</li>
<li>After reconsideration, the President will act in accordance with the advice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 8.<br />
The parliamentary system of executive vests many powers in the legislature for controlling the executive. Why, do you think, is it so necessary to control the executive?<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>In a parliamentary system, the Prime Minister is the head of the government alongwith the President as a nominal head of the government</li>
<li>The executive is responsible to the parliament and holds powers till it enjoys the confidence of the parliament.</li>
<li>It is necessary to ensure the sensitivity towards public expectations and accountability to the needs and aspirations of the people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 9.<br />
It is said that there is too much political interference in the working of the administrative machinery. It is suggested that there should be more and more autonomous agencies which do not have to answer to the ministers.<br />
(a) Do you think this will make administration more people-friendly?<br />
(b) Do you think this will make administration more efficient?<br />
(c) Does democracy mean full control of elected representatives over the administration?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) This will not make administration more friendly to the people.<br />
In a democracy, the elected representatives and the ministers are the in-charge of the government.<br />
Hence, the administrative officers cannot act in violation of the policies adopted by the legislature.<br />
The administrative machinery is supposed to be faithful and efficient in policy formation and implementation.</p>
<p>(b) Yes, if there would be autonomous agencies, it will make administration more efficient.</p>
<p>(c) The elected representatives enjoy the right to make the policies but the administrative officers implement those policies effectively and efficiently. Hence, democracy does not refer full control of elected representatives over administration.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Write an essay of two hundred words on the proposal to have an elected administration instead of an appointed administration.<br />
Answer:<br />
An elected administration in place of an appointed administration would be harmful because an elected administration will have instability to implement the different policies whereas the appointed administration is selected on the basis of merit to handle the welfare policies of the government in an effective manner alongwith full knowledge and practical approach of their concerned departments. Hence, the appointed administration is more efficient and capable to implement and perform the developmental functions. An appointed administration will also be able to perform the functions of planning and social welfare.</p>

Relation between the legislature and the executive makes passing of good laws possible. Moreover, parliamentary form of government has been working in India for past long years, hence it is the most suitable for India.</p>

They also wanted the members of the civil services or bureaucracy to be impartially selected on the basis of merit. So, the Union Public Service Commission has been entrusted with the task of conducting the process of recruitment of the civil servants for the government of India. Similar public service commissions are provided for the States also. Members of the Public Service Commissions are appointed for a fixed term. Their removal or suspension is subject to a thorough enquiry made by a judge of the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The President also has veto power by which he can withhold or refuse to give assent to Bills (other than Money Bill) passed by the Parliament. Every bill passed by the Parliament goes to the President for his assent before it becomes a law. The President can send the bill back to the Parliament asking it to reconsider the bill. This “veto’ power is limited because, if the Parliament passes the same bill again and sends it back to the President, then, the President has to give assent to that bill. However, there is no mention in the Constitution about the time limit within which the President must send the bill back for reconsideration. This means that the President can just keep the bill pending with him without any time limit. This gives the President an informal power to use the veto in a very effective manner. This is sometimes referred to as ‘pocket veto’.</p>
