<p style="text-align: center;">SECTION-A<br />
READING</p>
<p>Question 1:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions/complete the statements that follow:<br />
Today budgies-often called lovebirds in India -are the most popular pet birds in the world. All the adored cage birds of today are the descendants of parrots. They are one of the smallest of the world’s 330 parrot species which have come down from a plucky little bird in rural Australia.</p>
<p>Some appear to be about 30 cm long from tail tip to crown, with bulbous, fluffy foreheads, barrel chests and deep-set eyes. Their colours are striking; vivid shades of blue, grey and green as well as violet and white. Most startling of all are the yolk- yellow birds, called Latinas that are like splashes of luminous paint. The first colour mutations in captive birds were blue and yellow. Today, breeders raise birds with rainbow of colours.</p>
<p>Love birds stay near water when it’s dry, but when there’s a lot of rain they spread out. They are sometimes seen nestling on top of tall eucalyptus trees. While some of the caged varieties would have difficulty flying across a room, wild budgies travel hundreds of kilometers at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour to seek seed and water. Even in prolonged droughts, the budgie has an extraordinary ability to withstand dehydration. When deprived of water, budgies can reportedly exist with little weight loss for more than a month at an average air temperature of 30 degrees. At 20 degrees, some can apparently survive’ indefinitely without water, provided they are getting some moisture from food.</p>
<p>Male budgies can be excellent mimics and can develop huge vocabularies. Hens may whistle and can learn a few words, but they are not nearly as loquacious as males. Budgies are diamorphic upon sexual maturity. Adult males of most colours, except albino and the very pale pastels, develop a blue colour. Hens have a lilac or tan colour that turns brownish upon maturity.<br />
(a) Name the most popular pet birds in the world?<br />
(b) Who were the ancestors of the caged birds?<br />
(c) Where do love birds stay during dry weather?<br />
(d) What do you know about the travelling capacity of budgies?<br />
(e) Why according to the author, are budgies tough birds?<br />
(f) How are male budgies better than hens with regard to learning words and mimicry?<br />
(g) Which colour do hens develop upon maturity?<br />
(h) Find the word from the passage which means ’talkative’, (para 4)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Budgies<br />
(b) parrots<br />
(c) near water<br />
(d) Budgies can travel hundreds of kms upto 50 kms per hour<br />
(e) Budgies are tough birds because they can withstand dehydration; can exist with little water loss at 30 degree temperature<br />
(f) Male budgies are excellent mimics; have the ability to develop large vocabularies<br />
(g) brownish<br />
(h) loquacious</p>
<p>Question 2:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:</p>

<li>One of the principal values of travelling is that, it breaks the monotony of life and work. Life, for most people, is a mad rush from one place to another, from one activity to another, trying to gather as much as possible.</li>
<li>In this process, people tend to forget who they are and what they are. There is no time to ponder ’ and wonder. They tend to forget the values of life. Travelling is a time when people relax, reflect and ponder. Most people, after a pleasant travel, return home with a fresh outlook, new zeal and a better determination.</li>
<li>Travelling has also a great informative value. It widens the grasp of our knowledge of geography, different cultures and people etc. For example, when people of Assam visit South India, they learn a great deal. They come to know about the geographical features of South India, such as the existence of numerous rivers, coconut groves, backwaters, spice gardens, rubber plantations, oceans, seas, factories and cities, etc.</li>
<li>They also learn many things about the Dravidian culture which characterise the people’s style of living there. They come to know about their mode of living, social life, agriculture, worship, beliefs, art forms, etc. Such a visit is bound to enlighten the visitor and make him/her more appreciative of other cultures.</li>
<li>The beauty and the cold of the hills, the charm of the valleys, the chirping of the birds, the song of the rivers, the howling of animals, pleasant air, quiet places, etc., can heal many of our mental and physical problems. In the Indian<br />
context, travelling and visiting places have another important value that of understanding other’s traditions and cultures.</li>
<li>A visit to various parts of India will make us realize that India is a mosaic of cultures, races and creed and that diversity is the chief hall mark of our land. In this context, travelling can help national integration and unity to a great extent.</li>
<li>Thus, travelling has a tremendous educative, informative and social value. It widens people’s mental horizon, improves health, adds thrill and relaxation to life, dispels boredom and helps promote national integration. Therefore, educational tour should become an integral part of modern education. Travelling also boosts our national economy and the development of tourism industry.</li>

WRITING AND GRAMMAR</p>
<p>Question 3:<br />
You are Rahul/Rithika of class nine. You were shocked when you came across the following 5 statistics about children in India.<br />
Only 53% of inhabited India has a primary school.<br />
17 million children are child labourers. 50% of Indian children are malnourished Write an article for your school magazine expressing your views on the pathetic condition of children, suggesting ways to improve the situation. (100-120 words)<br />
Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Pathetic Condition of Children<br />
By Rahul</p>
<p>Children are one of the most vulnerable sections of Indian society. They are the building blocks of the nation who are exploited to extreme. They are innocent, tender, shy and due to these characteristics, they are bitterly exploited. I was shocked when I came across about the data that only 53% of inhabited India has a primary school. 17 million children are child labourers and 50% of Indian children are malnourished. How can a country like India be developed when such a large number of children can’t get even primary education. Child labour is a curse to society even then, large number of children are forced to adopt labour to support their families or for some other reasons. Besides it, malnutrition is also a curse because children can’t be strong in this state. So this is the responsibility of the Government and the society to improve the condition of the children for a better future of India.</p>
<p>Question 4:<br />
Every drop counts. Let’s not waste so that others may survive. Develop a story in about 200-250 words with a suitable title.<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">For a Drop of Water!</p>
<p>It was 25th of June last year. I can’t forget the day. It was an excessive hot day. The summer was at its full swing. It seemed as if fire was pouring down from the sky. The mother earth was ailing in want of water. Not a bird or beast was visible in the open.</p>
<p>There was not a stir of air anywhere. Not even a leaf was moving. The atmosphere was stuffy, and suffocated. To add to our troubles, there was no electric current. It resulted in the betrayal of water taps also in addition to the fan and coolers. My brother’s body was burning with blistering heat. He couldn’t even cry as his throat was absolutely dry. There was not even a single drop of water in taps as well as in the storage. All of us were very thirsty but at that time, we were much troubled on seeing his condition.</p>
<p>I went out of the house. At the corner of our lane, there was a departmental store. I went there in hope of getting ice-pouch or water bottle. But it was not available at any cost because there had been no water supply since last 24 hours. My brother’s uneasiness was getting unbearable with every moment. He was becoming excessively impatient and restless. His forehead was burning like hot- oven. My mother started weeping on seeing his condition.</p>
<p>Suddenly my father, who had gone to another city returned. He had the habit of carrying water bottle with him. Perhaps God made my father’s entry at the right moment. Immediately my brother drank some water, which prevented him from fainting. Then we took him to the hospital for his further treatment.</p>
<p>That day onwards, I never wasted even a drop of water, for even a drop can save someone’s life.</p>

<p>OR</p>
<p>Comment on the end of the novel &#8220;Three men in a Boat.’<br />
Answer:<br />
Gulliver became very friendly with the king of Brobdingnag. He told him many things about his country—the people, the system of his land but, the king did not find them valuable. Gulliver was bent upon making the king happy before leaving Brobdingnag. To thank the king for his hospitality, Gulliver offered him the recipe of gun-powder. The king was horrified at the inhumane idea of destroying the enemies. He was a simple and honest man who believed in peace. He didn’t want to produce such weapons of mass destruction. He thought that the use of such destructive weapons was inhuman and heartless. He said that he would rather give half of his country away than to know the secret of gun-powder.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Value Points:<br />
30 feet tall, dominated, malicious by nature, troubled Gulliver, banished from the court.<br />
Detailed Answer:<br />
The dwarf was the pet of the queen at Brobdingnag. The dwarf was about thirty feet tall and was short enough in comparison to other people at Brobdingnag. The dwarf was completely resistant to Gulliver. He was always jealous of the attention the queen paid to Gulliver.<br />
He did small jobs for the queen. He was pampered and spoiled by the queen. He became an enemy of Gulliver as the queen had become fond of him. Thus, the dwarf tried to tease Gulliver on each opportunity. Once he squeezed Gulliver’s legs, and pushed him into a bone marrow. He even tried to put him into a large bowl of cream to drown. The queen punished him for that evil act. This punishment increased the anger of the dwarf. Thus, the dwarf lost his position and love of the queen because of Gulliver. Because he used to trouble Gulliver, so he was banished from the court.<br />
Then, the queen sent him away on knowing all these actions of the dwarf.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Value points:<br />
• Clifton Hampden &#8211; a wonderfully pretty village, old &#8211; fashioned, peaceful, and dainty with flowers-river scenery rich and beautiful &#8211; if you stay the night on land at Clifton, you cannot do better than put up at the Barley Mow- the quaintest, most old &#8211; world inn up the river &#8211; stands on the right of the bridge, quite away from the village low &#8211; pitched gables and thatched roof and latticed windows give it quite a story &#8211; book appearance, while inside it is even still more fanciful.<br />
Detailed Answer:<br />
Clifton Hampden was a wonderful pretty village, old fashioned, peaceful, dainty with flowers and with a scenery of river, very rich and beautiful. The best place to put up during your stay at Clifton would not be better than the Barley Mow, the quaintest and the most old world inn, up the river which stands on the right of the bridge, quite away from the village. It had low pitched gables and thatched roof with latticed windows which gives it quite like a story book appearance. Inside of it was even more fanciful.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Having taken a silent decision to return back-board a train now-they felt they had deceived the boatman at Pang Bourne-they did not have the face to tell him that they were running away from the rain-left the, boat, and all it contained, in his charge, with instructions that it was to be ready for them at nine the next morning-anything unforeseen should happen, preventing their return, they would write to him -reached Paddington at seven, and drove direct to the restaurant-partook of a light meal, left Montmorency, together with suggestions for a supper to be read}’ at half-past ten, and then continued their way to Leicester Square. All’s w-ell that ends well-three men in a boat were now’ three men out of a boat-instead of sacrificing their lives to the fury of nature-they chose to go to a restaurant-have a full-fledged supper-enjoy the ballet-they were so tired-it was a sensible decision-chose to stay alive although they did not want to be cowards-rain slammed their spirits to proceed further in boat-they came back safe.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
The three friends had to abandon the journey in a boat because of continuous rain. They caught a train and reached Paddington at seven and went directly to the restaurant where they had a light meal. After giving orders for a supper at half past seven, they went to Leicester Square. As they were not in proper dress, and were wet, they attracted a good deal of attention at the Alhambra. They got in with much difficulty and enjoyed a ballet. They came back to the restaurant where their supper was ready. The food was simple but nutritious.<br />
Harris remarked that they had a good trip. He raised his glass and cheered to ’Three men well out of a boat’. The dog Montmorency gave a short bark in agreement with the toast.<br />
So the three men and dog quietly left and finally went to their homes. They had left their boat behind to be collected later on.</p>
