<p style="text-align: center;">SECTION-A<br />
READING</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions / complete the sentences that follow:<br />
In India, as perhaps in many other countries of the world, trees have been held in veneration since ancient times. Our rishis of yore retired to forests to meditate and to do penance amidst trees and &#8220;far from the madding crowd&#8221;. Our forbears loved trees and forests so much so that, they even deified and worshipped them as abodes of Vrikshadevata and Vanadevata. Many of them were not cut without good reason. In ancient India, groves of trees and flower gardens were reared with loving care.<br />
In ancient Sanskrit literature, there are many references of young maidens kicking the Ashoka tree to make it flower. But in fact, the kick can be administered by anyone. The method seems to work, though nobody really knows why? Some say the kick interrupts the flow of water upwards, triggering a defence mechanism which causes the tree to flower.<br />
In Western countries people beat their walnut trees to encourage them to bear fruit. It is believed that a good beating ensures a good crop of walnuts. Like the Ashoka, the Walnut too is a tall tree. Perhaps all tall trees benefit occasionally from a beating sound.<br />
In parts of Uttar Pradesh, they resort to another stratagem to get mango trees to flower. If a tree has not given fruit in a particular year, the owner, accompanied by three or four friends, walks menacingly towards it with an axe and loudly announces his intention of cutting down the tree. His friends persuade him not to do so.<br />
When he has gone they berate the tree for not giving fruit and advise it to give plenty of fruit the next time if it wants to live. The method is said to give good results.<br />

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">(a) Why did our rishis retire to forests?<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:<br />
On November first, Chandran left his bed at 5 a.m, bathed in cold water, and sat at his study table, even before his mother, the earliest riser of the house, was up. He sat there, strengthening himself with several resolutions. One was that he would get up every day at the same hour, bathe in cold water, and get through three hours of solid work before starting for the college. The second resolution was that he would be back home before eight in the evening and study till eleven-thirty. He also resolved not to smoke because it was bad for the heart, and a very sound heart was necessary for the examination.<br />
He took out a sheet of paper and noted down all his subjects. He calculated the total number of preparation hours that were available from November first to March. He had before him over a thousand hours, including the twelve hour, preparation on holidays. Of these thousand hours, a just allotment of so many hundred hours was to be made for Modern History, Ancient History, Political Theories, Greek Drama, Eighteenth-century Prose, and Shakespeare. He then drew up a very complicated time-table, which would enable one to pay equal attention to all subjects. Balance in preparation was everything. What was the use of being able to score a hundred percent in Modern History, if Shakespeare was going to drag you in the mire ? Out of the daily six hours, three were to be devoted to the Optional Subjects and three to the compulsory. In the morning the compulsory subjects, and Literature at night. European History needed all the freshness and sharpness of the morning brain, while it would be a real pleasure to read Literature in the evenings. He put down for that day Othello and the Modern Period in Indian History. He would finish these two in about forty-eight hours and then take up Milton and Greek History.<br />
And he settled down to his programme with a scowl on his face.<br />
The Modern Period in Indian History, which he had to take up immediately, presented innumerable difficulties. The texts on the subject were many, the notes<br />
of class lectures very bulky. Chandran sat for nearly half an hour lost in this problem.<br />
The household was up by this time. His father was in the garden, minutely examining the plants for evidence of any miracle which might have happened overnight.<br />
(A) Answer the following questions :<br />

Answer:<br />
Value Points:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">• Road littered with garbage.<br />
• Stinking smell poses great health hazard.<br />
• Unhygienic conditions may lead to epidemic.<br />
• Pollutes the environment.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Subject: Littering Roads Create Havoc<br />
Sir,<br />
Owing to the MCD employees’ strike, the roads in our area are littering with garbage. If garbage heaps around in a residential area, it not only presents an unpleasant sight but also poses a potential health hazard. This is precisely the problem in this part of the capital which I seek to bring to the notice of the concerned authorities through the columns of your reputed newspaper.<br />
Since Laxmi Nagar is a relatively new locality, there are numerous vacant plots, that are being invariably and insensitively used by the public to dump their garbage. The stench in the air is unbearable, not to mention the peril of an outbreak of infectious diseases.<br />
Attempts to counsel the people on the importance of community hygiene are being counter-argued, i.e., in the absence of proper dumping sites or dustbins, vacant spots are their only option.<br />
It is important that both the public as well as the authorities should take up a collective responsibility to maintain a clean environment and contribute towards the common good.<br />
I hope this letter of mine will awake the concerned authorities, who, inturn, will take necessary action at the earliest to prevent the residents from any epidemic.<br />
Thanking you.<br />
Yours faithfully Miki</p>

Good Manners<br />
&#8220;A man’s manners are a mirror in which he shows by his portrait&#8221;. This quote highlights the importance of good manners in life. To possess good manners is, in fact, the first step to success. They cost nothing but they polish and enrich the personality of a man, which inturn, makes his life easy due to his special trait of politeness. Such persons earn respect in society.<br />
Good manners are superior to riches. Wealth attracts fair-weather friends only but good manners win for us permanent friends as they create our goodwill in society. All great men, who made their mark in life, were polite, humble and gentle. A person with charming manners can win over others with a smile. On its contrary, an ill- mannered person can not command respect of anybody. We can’t learn such manners from books. What we have to do is just to respect our elders; to help weak and poor; not to offend others by harsh words. Instead, we should use words like ’Thank you’, ’Please’, ’Sorry’ as an important part of our conversation with others. We should be ready to make little sacrifices in others service, when needed. Above all, we should be fair and just in our dealings with others. If we are sensitive and responsive to others with our good manners, we’ll be liked by all.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">Rocking Rocks</p>
<p>It was a cold winter night. Many friends and relatives of mine had come to our house to enjoy the Christmas holidays. After enjoying, campfire and sumptuous dinner, we went to bed quite early as singing, dancing and merry-making had made us tired. We all were sound asleep. Suddenly I heard a thudding sound. I, immediately switched on the lights. Meanwhile, my father also came there and sensed something wrong. Then, once again, thudding and rumbling sound was heard which sent a shiver down our spine. My father had awaken all the family members in the house. It was understood that the energy under our feet had been hit by a deadly earth quake. With hurried foulbleps, ail of us ran uul snouting to alert as many peupie as we cuuiu. People rushed out from their homes. The earthquake lasted for one minute only but those terrible moments had brought death, destruction and doom. Many buildings in the town were collapsed by that destructive earthquake. Even in our colony, 20 people were found missing and many more lay buried under the debris. The worst-hit victims were the slum dwellers. Thousands of them were rendered homeless as their houses/huts collapsed; children became orphans. As usual, the relief team appeared there but quite late. Meanwhile, the people who were fortunate enough like us, did the needful. The havoc caused by the earthquake will haunt me forever.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>It was a family picnic. The picnic spot was on bank of a river. We went for the picnic after a long time. The most surprising part about this picnic was that it was organised by my father as he had got a promotion in his office. My mother prepared lip smacking delicacies for all of us. We all got up early in the morning. The weather was<br />
absolutely perfect to be on the river side. As we reached the spot, we saw many people enjoying there. Many vendors were walking arfiund providing things for refreshment. My brother had a badminton set and football with him. We both enjoyed playing badminton. When we got tired, mother offered us the food she brought with her. We had our lunch. When we were having our lunch, a poor girl, selling balloons came to me and requested me to buy a balloon so that she could arrange food for herself. Hearing this, my father gave money to me and asked to buy all the balloons. The girl got very happy. My brother went with her to the shop to help her buy food. She took the food to her younger brother who was waiting for her. After lunch, we went for a small walk around river bank and reached home, though tired but extremely happy after having a wonderful time.</p>

One must be ambitious in life &#8211; Valli was so &#8211; a simple desire, to ride a bus &#8211; watched the bus, its schedule, listened to people’s conversation about their journey &#8211; fare &#8211; collected 30 paise (any other relevant points)<br />
Detailed Answer:<br />
Yes, it is true that whenever we want something, difficulties do come on our way. But one must be ambitious in life. Achieving goals require perseverance. Valli wanted to ride the bus, however, she did not have the money to do. The challenge in front of her was to arrange for the required amount of money. Valli had carefully saved whatever stray coins came her way, resisting every temptation to buy peppermints, toys, balloons and the like. Finally, she had collected 30 paise. Moreover, she watched the bus, its routine and schedule very carefully. She also listened to people’s conversation about their journey. But dint of her efforts, finally she accomplished her desire.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Wild animals should not be caged. This is a well known fact that tiger is a royal species which is on the verge of extinction. In ancient times tigers moved around freely in the forests. But today they are caged and left in the zoo for the entertainment of people.<br />
In fact, they are not meant for confinement. The result is that their off spring also do not learn to hunt, when they are caged. Caging wild animals also leads to disturbance of ecological balance. So, wild animals should be let free. They belong to the forest. Cages are not meant for a wild animal specially for a tiger.</p>

<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Miss Sullivan had taken Helen by the hand across the fields to the banks of the Tennessee River. Sitting on the warm grass, she began the first lessons for Helen in the beneficence of nature. As Helen’s knowledge of these things grew, she felt more and more the delight of the world she lived in. Long before she learned to do a sum in arithmetic or describe the shape of the earth. She linked her earliest thoughts with nature and made her attuned to the beauty that abounds in the world. Her teaching methods were not par for the course. As no material for the blind was available at that time and teachers were going at their normal pace, Ms. Sullivan’s help enabled her to keep pace with them. Here, in combridge, she could not spell out everything in Helen’s hand all that was explained in the books and it was difficult to make her available the embossed books in time. But she believed in the natural capabilities of nature to educate the sportive Helen as the girl herself was so eager to learn from anything around her. Miss Sullivan understood the true capabilities of her student and designed her teaching methods accordingly.</p>

She was a gentle and caring girl. She generally submitted to Keller’s tyranny and never created a situation of a hand-to-hand encounter, as it happens generally in childhood. She shared a great deal of time with Helen in the kitchen, kneading dough balls, helping each other to make ice-cream, grinding coffee, feeding hens and turkeys etc. She could very well understand her sign language. She was also a great partner of Helen in doing mischiefs.<br />

• Wrong opinion of the Christians towards Jews who were denouncing their helpers and causing them to suffer the dreadful fate and punishment.<br />
• Germans misunderstood and maltreated Jews.<br />
• Jews were regarded as lesser beings who were oppressed by the Germans.<br />
• Only hope from the Dutch to be fair to them.</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Anne had developed a great hatred for Jews. It can be said that she had misconception about Jews. In fact all the Germans had negative attitude towards Jews. Even Christians had also the wrong opinion towards Jews. They were denouncing their helpers and causing them to suffer the dreadful fate and punishment. Jews were not only misunderstood by Germans but also were maltreated by them. They were regarded as lesser beings so they were oppressed by them, Jews had the only hope that they would be fair to them in behaviour as well as in attitude. Otherwise, their condition was pitiable all over the world.<br />
Even Anne’s statement is also symbolic of the same attitude. If something wrong was done by any Christian, then only that very person was considered responsible for the same but the scenario was different in the case of Jews. If some misdeed was performed by any of the Jews, the whole community was taken as responsible. In this way, they had to bear maltreatment done towards them.</p>

5. Hides food in his cupboard &#8211; does not share with anyone, not even with those who always help him.<br />
6. Rude, cannot speak politely.<br />
7. Poor hygiene</p>
<p>Detailed Answer:<br />
Alfred Dussel was a dentist and an acquaintance of the Franks who hid with them in the Annexe. He shared a room with Anne. Anne suffered the brunt of his odd personal hygiene habits, pedantic lectures and controlling tendencies. Mr. Dussel’s wife was a Christian, so she did not go into hiding, and he was separated from her. He never cared for the feelings of others and turned out to be an irresponsible person. He was the eighth entrant of the house. The other residents of the Annexe found him to be a selfish man who never bothered to care about others. None of them ever found him to be helpful in any matter. He was always confined to himself. The people of the Annexe had grown a dislike towards him. At many occasions, he committed a mistake, later apologized for it but only to repeat it again e.g., he put Miep into peril by demanding a banned book. He was an ungrateful personality who showed an irresponsible behaviour through out his stay at the Annexe.<br />
Anne disliked him for his self-centred nature. He often used to scold her and made it a point to tell her about her short coming. Anne, had shared her room with him but when she asked him to let her use the table for two more hours, he bluntly refused, giving Anne a shock. He also enjoyed creating trouble between Anne and her mother. He was not in the good books of others as even the residents found that he had started hiding eatables in the cupboard.<br />
He was an irresponsible man as he disobeyed the restrictions, posed on the residents due to the war. He died in a concentration camp in December 1944.</p>
