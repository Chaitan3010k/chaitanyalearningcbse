<p>2. The Tense of a Verb shows the time when an action takes place.<br />
There are three Tenses :</p>
<p>I. Present Tense<br />
II. Past Tense<br />
III. Future Tense</p>
<p>3. In order to show at what stage an action is, each of the three tenses has been sub-divided into four heads. These sub-divisions are—</p>

<p>Thus, the tense of a verb does not show the time of an action or event alone. It shows the state of that action also.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I. The Present Tense</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Simple Present Tense</strong><br />
The Simple Present is used to express :<br />
(i) A habitual action<br />
(ii) A general truth<br />
(iii) What is happening (in exclamatory sentences only)<br />
(iv) An order or request.</p>
<p>(i) A habitual action :<br />
I go for a walk daily.<br />
He comes to school at 8 O’clock.</p>
<p>(ii) General truth :<br />
The sun rises in the east.<br />
Two and two make four.</p>
<p>(iii) What is happening :<br />
Here comes the chief guest !</p>
<p>(iv) An order or request :<br />
Obey your teachers.</p>

<p><strong>C. THE PAST PERFECT TENSE</strong><br />
<strong>(Subject + had + III form of the Verb )</strong></p>
<p>We often make mistakes while using the Past Perfect Tense. We use &#8216;had&#8217; at random wherever we view ‘past action&#8217; in a sentence in our mother-tongue.<br />
I had gone to Delhi yesterday.<br />
This sentence should be formed in Simple past.<br />
I went to Delhi yesterday.<br />
The structure of Past Perfect is—<br />
In order to form the Past Perfect Tense we use &#8216;had&#8217; before the Past Participle (III) form of the Verb.</p>
<p>(i) In Interrogative form [‘Had is used before the subject]<br />
(Had + Subject + not + in form of the Verb + &#8230;&#8230;&#8230; ?)<br />
Had he left when you came ?</p>
<p>(ii) In Negative form [&#8216;not is used after &#8216;had&#8217;]<br />
(Subject + had + not + III form of the Verb + &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; )<br />
I had not seen you before.</p>
<p><strong>Uses of the Past Perfect Tense</strong><br />
(a) The Past Perfect Tense is used to express an action completed before another action took place ; as—<br />
When he came to me, I had posted the letter.<br />
(b) (i) It is also used to express an unfulfilled action in the past ; as—<br />
If she had worked hard she would have passed.<br />
(ii) It is also used to express an unfulfilled wish in the past ; as—<br />
I wish I had won the election.<br />
(c) To denote the action or event which has been completed before some point of<br />
time.<br />
By afternoon he had completed much work.</p>
<p><strong>Use of Past Indefinite and Past Perfect Tenses in Time Clauses</strong><br />

<strong>Examples:</strong> I had waited for my friend until he arrived.<br />
After he had sailed many days, the mariner reached the coast.</p>
