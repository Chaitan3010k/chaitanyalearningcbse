<p><strong>III. Answer the question in two or three paragraphs (100-150 words).</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
How does Evelyn hear music?<br />
Answer:<br />
Evelyn became deaf by the time she was eleven. But she did not give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. Ron Forbes, a percussionist spotted her potential. He asked her not to listen through ears but try to sense it some other way. She realized she could feel the higher drum from the waist up and the lower one from the waist down. Forbes repeated the exercise and soon Evelyn discovered that she could sense certain notes in different parts of her body. She learnt to open her body and mind to sounds and vibrations. She herself explained, “It pours in through every part of my body. It tingles in the skin, my cheekbones and even in my hair.” When she played on the xylophone, she could sense the sound passing up the stick into her fingertips. By leaning against the drums, she could feel the resonances flowing into her body. On the wooden floor she used to remove her shoes so that the vibrations may pass through her bare feet and up her legs.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking </strong><br />
<strong>(Page 28)</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Imagine the famous singer Kishori Amonkar is going to visit your school. You have been asked to introduce her to the audience before her performance. How would you introduce her?<br />
Here is some information about Kishori Amonkar you can find on the internet. Read the passage and make notes of the main points about:</p>
<ul>
<li>her parentage</li>
<li>the school of music she belongs to</li>
<li>her achievements</li>
<li>her inspiration • awards</li>
</ul>
<p>Padma Bhushan recipient Kishori Amonkar, widely considered the finest female vocalist of her generation, was bom in 1931. She is the daughter of another great artist, Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar. In her early years she absorbed the approach and repertoire of her distinguished mother’s teacher Ustad Alladiya Khan. As her own style developed, she moved away from Alladiya Khan’s ‘Jaipur-Atrauli Gharana’s style in some respects. As a mature artist her approach is usually regarded as an individual, if not unique, variant of the Jaipur model.</p>
<p>Kishori Amonkar is a thinker. She is besotted by what she calls the mysterious world of her raagas. She dissects them with the precision of a perfectionist, almost like a scientist, until the most subtle of shades and emotions emerge and re-emerge.</p>
<p>She is very much inspired by the teachings of the ancient Vedic sages, written at a time when vocal music was highly devotional in character.</p>
<p>This soul-searching quality of her music, coupled with a very intellectual approach to raaga performance has gained her quite a following in India and has helped to revive the study of khayal.</p>
<p>Significant awards bestowed on this artist include the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1985), the Padma Bhushan (1987), and the highly coveted Sangeet Samradhini Award (considered one of the most prestigious awards in Indian Classical Music) in 1997.<br />
Answer:<br />
Do it yourself.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Use your notes on Kishori Amonkar to introduce her to an imaginary audience.</p>
<p>You may use one of the following phrases to introduce a guest:<br />
I am honoured to introduce&#8230;/! feel privileged to introduce&#8230;/‘We welcome you’&#8230;<br />
Answer:<br />
It’s my proud privilege that I have been honoured to introduce you to the famous singer Kishori Amonkar, the finest female vocalist of her generation. She was bom in 1931 to the great artist Smt. Mogubai Kurdikar. She is a thinker who dissects the raagas with the precision of a perfectionist so that the raagas can be inspirational for the common masses. She is greatly inspired by the teachings of the ancient vedic sages. She is conferred with the significant awards viz., the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award (1985), the Padma Bhushan (1987) and the highly coveted Sangeet Samradhini Award in 1997.</p>
<p><strong>Writing </strong><br />
<strong>(Page 29)</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
“If you work hard and know where you’re going, you’ll get there,” says Evelyn Glennie. You have now read about two musicians, Evelyn Glennie and Ustad Bismillah Khan. Do you think that they both worked hard? Where did they want to ‘go’? Answer these questions in two paragraphs, one on each of the two musicians.<br />
Answer:<br />
Yes, they both worked hard. It is a fact that dedication and determination help one in attaining one’s long cherished goals. Evelyn Glennie was profoundly deaf. She was not ready to give up. She was determined to lead a normal life and pursue her interest in music. She worked hard and got Royal Philharmonic Society’s prestigious Soloist of the Year Award in 1991. She accomplished more than most people twice her age.</p>
<p>Ustad Bismillah Khan belongs to a well known family of musicians from Bihar. He took to music early in life. He gave many memorable performances in India and abroad. He practised hard and reached his destination in 2001 when he was awarded India’s highest civilian award, the Bharat Ratna. The other National Awards like the Padmashri, the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan were also conferred on him. His life has been a perfect example of the rich, cultural heritage of India.</p>

•&#8221;Pungi&#8221; a musical instrument, was banned by Emperor Aurangzeb, because of its shrill and unpleasant sound. In fact, it was regarded more as a noise maker rather than a musical instrument. It was modified and perfected by a barber who belonged to a family of professional musicians. He played it in the chamber of the king. Its sound was so appreciated by the emperor that it was made a part of Naubat. Since it was played for the first time in Shah&#8217;s chamber by a Nai, it came to be known as Shehnai.<br />
•Traditionally, it was played in the temples and on every auspicious domestic occasions also. Its sound was regarded as auspicious. But it was treated as an incomplete musical instrument, not capable of creating independent pages. But Bismillah Khan broke this myth.<br />
•Bismillah belongs to the Benares Gharana. He was bom in 1916 at Dumraon, in Bihar. As a 5 year old, he used to visit the Bihariji Temple and sing Bhojpuri &#8220;Chaitya&#8221; there. For his melodious singing he used to earn a big Laddu from the local Bhojpuri King. At the age of 6, he moved to Benares. There under the guidance and training of his maternal uncle, Ali Bux, he started picking up the finer nuances of shehnai. He used to spend most of his time practicing on the banks of the River Ganges. The themes of his music were deeply affected by the sounds of flowing water of the Ganga.<br />
•He got the best performer award at All India Music Conference in Allahabad in 1930. In 2001, he won 3 awards&#8217;the Padma Bhushan, Padmashree and Padma Vibhushan. He was invited to play the shehnai from the ramparts of the Red Fort in 194?, becoming the first to greet the independent India. He won many international awards also. He became the first Indian to perform at titje Lincoln Central Hall, in USA. An auditorium in Tehran was named after him-Tahar Mosiquee Ustaad Bismillah Khan.<br />
•Bismillah was very fond of Benares and Dumraon. He declined an offer from one of his students to settle in the USA, as he was not willing to stay away for long from Benaras and its holy river Ganga. He ventured into film world also. He gave his music in 2 movies. His composition &#8220;Dil ka khillonahai &#8221; for movie &#8220;Goonj Uthi Shehnai&#8221;, was a chartbuster.
