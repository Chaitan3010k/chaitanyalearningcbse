<p>Question 3.<br />
“I looked into the mirror and smiled,” says the doctor. A little later he says, “I forgot my danger and smiled feebly at myself.” What is the doctor’s opinion about himself when (i) he first smiles, and (ii) he smiles again? In what way do his thoughts change in between, and why?<br />
Answer:<br />
The doctor thought that he had a good smile when he first smiled. But when he smiled a little later, he laughed at his destiny. His life was in danger. His thoughts got changed because of the snake. He was quite near to death.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking</strong><br />
<strong>(Page 63)</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Using some of the expressions given above in exercise III, talk about an incident when you were very scared. You may have a competition to decide whose story was the most frightening.<br />
Answer:<br />
For self-attempt.</p>
<p><strong>Dictation</strong><br />
<strong>(Page 63)</strong></p>
<p>The following paragraph is about the Indian Cobra. Read it twice and close your book. Your teacher will then dictate the paragraph to you. Write it down with appropriate punctuation marks.</p>
<p>The Indian cobra is the common name for members of the family of venomous snakes, known for their intimidating looks and deadly bite. Cobras are recognized by the heads that they flare when angry or disturbed; the heads are created by the extension of the ribs behind the cobras’ heads. Obviously the best prevention is to avoid getting bitten. This is facilitated by the fact that humans are not the natural prey of any venomous snake. We are a bit large for them to swallow whole and they have no means of chopping us up into bite-size pieces. Nearly all snakebites in humans are the result of a snake defending itself when it feels threatened. In general snakes are shy and will simply leave if you give them a chance.</p>

<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104171" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-9-English-Beehive-Chapter-5-The-Snake-and-the-Mirror-Page-63-Q2.jpg" alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 9 English Beehive Chapter 5 The Snake and the Mirror Page 63 Q2" width="184" height="173" /></p>
<p>The fairest of them all</p>
<p>A monkey preens itself using a piece of mirror, in the Delhi ridge.</p>
<p>(‘To preen oneself ’ means to spend a lot of time making oneself look attractive, and then admiring one’s appearance. The word is used in disapproval.)<br />
Answer:<br />
It was a sunny day. A monkey was walking in the garden. Fortunately he came to the comer of the garden and found a piece of miiTor. The monkey started looking in the mirror. First of all he looked his face in the mirror and was very happy. He thought that God has given him a human face. Again he looked his hands and fingers in the mirror. He was very proud because he realised that his hands were long and he could hold things easily. At last he decided to look his body in the mirror. This time he was not so much happy because it was full of hair. The monkey was sad and his hands started trembling. Unfortunately, the mirror fell down from his hand and broke into several pieces. When he tried to look his face in the pieces of mirror, he saw his cut faces. This time he became angry and left the place.</p>
