<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 5 Short Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 24.<br />
Explain why, fossil fuels are exhaustible natural resources.<br />
Answer:<br />
The amount of fossil fuels is very limited in nature. They can be exhausted by human activities. The formation of fossil fuels is a very slow process. These are formed under very high pressure and high temperature. For example, coal, petroleum and natural gas are fossil fuels. Coal was formed by the process of carbonisation. Carbonisation is the process by which plant material or vegetation buried deep under the earth was slowly converted into coal.</p>
<p>Question 25.<br />
Describe how coal was formed. What is this process called?<br />
Answer:<br />
Coal was formed millions and millions of years ago in swampy forests where some plants died and some grew simultaneously. As the years passed, the layers of dead plants collected one over the other and formed thick layers. With changing weather conditions, more plants grew and the layers of dead plants continued to form deep. Coal is a fossil fuel. The heat and the pressure produced physical and chemical changes in the layers which resulted in the rich carbon content and forced the oxygen into the environment. This rich carbon content became as coal. This process of forcing the oxygen out and leaving behind carbon content was called as carbonisation. In other words, Carbonisation is the process by which plant material or vegetation buried deep under the earth was slowly converted into coal. This is a very slow process and usually, takes millions of years.</p>
<p>Question 26.<br />
What is happens when coal is heated in air? State the uses of coal.<br />
Answer:<br />
When heated in air, coal burns and produces mainly carbon dioxide gas. Coal can be processed in industry to get some useful products such as coke, coal tar and coal gas. Coal is used as a fuel in industries and was used to cook food. It was used in railway engines to produce steam to run the engine. It is used in thermal power plants to produce electricity.</p>
<p>Question 27.<br />
State the uses of coke.<br />
Answer:<br />
Coke is a very useful product of coal. It is a tough, porous and black substance. It is almost pure form of carbon. It is used as a reducing agent in the extraction of metals. It is also used in the manufacture of steel and in the extraction of many metals.</p>
<p>Question 28.<br />
What are the constituents of coal gas? State one use of coal gas.<br />
Answer:<br />
Coal gas is a product of coal. It is obtained during the processing of coal to get coke. Coal gas contains a variety of gases like hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane and some volatile hydrocarbons. It also contains small quantities of gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It is used as a fuel in many industries situated near the coal processing plants.</p>
<p>Question 29.<br />
What are the major products (or fractions) of petroleum refining? Give one use of each petroleum product.<br />

<p>Question 39.<br />
What is the major cause of air pollution? Write the various tips for minimizing the wastage of petrol/diesel while driving vehicles.<br />
Answer:<br />
Burning of fossil fuels is the major cause of air pollution. Burning of fossil fuels affects the environment because they release carbon dioxide and other harmful gases such as Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxides. These gases trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and causes global warming which contributes to global climate change. It is therefore necessary that we use these fuels only when absolutely necessary. This will result in better environment, smaller risk of global warming and their availability for a longer period of time. In India, the Petroleum Conservation Research Association (PCRA) advises people how to save petrol or diesel while driving. Their tips are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drive at a constant and moderate speed as far as possible</li>
<li>Switch off the engine at traffic lights or at a place where you have to wait,</li>
<li>Make sure there is correct tyre pressure, and</li>
<li>Ensure regular maintenance of the vehicle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 40.<br />
Why should we use fossil fuels only when absolutely necessary?<br />
Answer:<br />
Burning of fossil fuels affects the environment due to the release carbon dioxide and other harmful gases such as Sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxides. These gases trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and causes global warming which contributes to global climate change. It is therefore necessary that we use these fuels only when absolutely necessary. It took millions of years for the dead organisms to get converted into these fuels. On the other hand, the known reserves of these fuels will last only a few hundred years. It is therefore, necessary to conserve these natural resources. This will also result in better environment, smaller risk of global warming and their availability for a longer period of time.</p>
<p>Question 41.<br />

The exhaustible natural resources which are formed from the dead remains of living organisms or fossils are known as fossil fuels. For example, coal, petroleum and natural gas are fossil fuels. The resources are present in limited amount in nature and are known as exhaustible natural resources. They can be exhausted by human activities.</p>
<p>Question 43 B.<br />
Describe how, fossil fuels were formed.<br />
Answer:<br />
The fossil fuel such as coal is formed from the remains of dead vegetation. Earth had dense forests in low lying wetland areas about 300 million years ago. Due to natural processes, like flooding, these forests got buried under the soil. Due to soil deposition over these dead plants, they were compressed. The temperature also increased as they sank deeper and deeper. Under high pressure and high temperature, dead plants got slowly converted to coal. As coal contains mainly carbon, the slow process of conversion of dead vegetation into coal is called carbonisation. Since it was formed from the remains of vegetation, coal is also called a fossil fuel.</p>
<p>The fossil fuel such as petroleum is formed from the dead animals under the sea. As these organisms died, their bodies settled at the bottom of the sea. They got covered with layers of sand and clay.
