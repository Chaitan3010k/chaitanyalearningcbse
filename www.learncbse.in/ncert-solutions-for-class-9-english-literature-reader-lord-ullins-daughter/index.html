Answer:<br />
Lord Ullifr’s beautiful daughter loves the Scottish chieftain passionately. Her father Lord Ullin is against their relationship and marriage. He is not favourably disposed to the Scottish chieftain.

<p>Question 10.<br />
Read the following lines and answer the questions that follow:<br />
“His horsemen hard behind us ride; Should they our steps discover,<br />
Then who will cheer my bonny bride When they have slain her lover?”<br />
(a) Who is ‘his’ in line 1? Who does ‘us’ refer to?<br />
(b) Explain: ‘cheer my bonny bride’.<br />
(c) Why would the lover be slain?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) ‘His’ stands for Lord Ullin. ‘Us’ refers to Lord Ullin’s daughter and her lover.<br />
(b) It means that if the Scottish chieftain is killed, there will be no one to look after and make his beautiful bride happy.<br />
(c) If the lover is caught, it is sure that he will be killed by Lord Ullin and his armed men. Lord Ullin doesn’t want his daughter to marry her lover.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
“The water-wraith was shrieking”. Is the symbolism in this line a premonition of what happens at the end ? Give reasons for your answer. (Stanza 7)<br />
Answer:<br />
Certainly the symbolism in this line is a premonition of what is about to happen at the end. The stormy sea is getting furious and the rising waves have assumed the shape of ghosts threatening to swallow the lovers in the tempest. Certainly, Lord Ullin’s beautiful daughter and her lover are going to meet their watery graves in the sea at the end.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
The poet uses words like ‘adown’, ‘rode’ which contain harsh consonants. Why do you think the poet has done this? (Stanza 8)<br />
Answer:<br />
The poet uses such hard consonants like ‘adown’ ‘rode’, etc. to heighten the effect of the great anger of Lord Ullin and his men, who are hotly chasing the two lovers. Similarly other hard consonants express the anger of the sea, sky and waves, ‘storm grew loud’, ‘scowl of heaven’ and ‘water wraith’, etc.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
In Stanza 10, the poet says—<br />
The boat has left a stormy land,<br />
A stormy sea before her,<br />
(а) In both these lines, the word “stormy” assumes different connotations. What are they?<br />
(b) The lady faces a dilemma herS. What is it? What choice does she finally make?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) In both these lines the word “stormy” assumes different connotations. ‘The stormy land’ here means the land where the passionate storm of Ullin’s daughter and her lover had ravaged the family. The boat left the stormy land where Lord Ullin and his stormy armed horsemen were giving the lovers a hot chase. ‘The stormy sea’ here means the furious stormy sea that faced their boat.</p>
<p>(b) Lord Ullin’s beautiful daughter somehow has to face a rough weather everywhere. If she goes back home, she will be confronted with the fury of a stormy father. So she decides to face the stormy sea and the scowling sky as she can’t face the anger of her father.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
(a)“Lord Ullin reached that fatal shore” just as his daughter left it. (Stanza 11). Why is the shore called fatal?<br />
(b) Why does Lord Ullin’s wrath change into wailing on seeing his daughter?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) It was too late for Lord Ullin. When he reached the shore, he saw with his own eyes his beautiful daughter lying dead on it. Hence, the shore has become ‘fatal’.<br />
(b) Lord Ullin gave a hot chase with his armed men to arrest and kill the lover of his daughter. But when he saw the dead body of his daughter lying on the shore, his anger changed into wailing and mourning.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
“One lovely hand she stretch’d for aid.” Do you think Lord Ullin’s daughter wanted to reach out to her father? (Stanza 12) If yes, why?<br />
Answer:<br />
It is only a speculation. Perhaps she heard her father giving assurance of forgiving them. That would have prompted the daughter stretching her hand for aid in those circumstances. Otherwise, she would have preferred facing the stormy sea and scowling sky to an angry father.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
You are already familiar with the poetic device “alliteration”. The poet makes extensive use of the same throughout the poem. Pick out as many examples of alliteration as you can.<br />
Example: fast &#8211; father’s; horsemen &#8211; hard.<br />
Answer:<br />
stormy &#8211; sea<br />
bonny- bride<br />
human- hand<br />
loud &#8211; lashed<br />
storm &#8211; shade<br />
water &#8211; wild went<br />
did &#8211; discover<br />
left &#8211; lamenting<br />
fast &#8211; father’s</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
What is the rhyme scheme of the poem?<br />
Answer:<br />
The rhyme scheme of the poem is ab, ab. In the last stanza, it is: ab, cb</p>
<p>Question 18.<br />
Imagine you are one of the chiefs of the cavalry riding behind Lord Ullin. You and your men ride for three days at the end of which you reach the shore. Narrate your experience as you witnessed a father lamenting the loss of his child, in the form of a diary entry.<br />
Answer:<br />
20th March 20XX<br />
10 pm.<br />
Lord Ullin’s anger knew no bounds. He couldn’t reconcile his daughter’s elopement with the chieftain of Ulva island. He wanted to catch them and put her lover to death. We were behind him. After three days of hard riding we reached the spot. We could see a boat caught among the stormy sea and the scowling sky. There we saw Lord Ullin wailing bitterly. He was crying most pathetically urging them to come back. He even gave an assurance Jo forgive them. But it was too late and therefore, in vain. The violent and the stormy sea engulfed the boat with its occupants. Lord Ullin was crying to see his beautiful daughter lying dead on the shore. One hand was extended for help and other hand was around her lover. Never had I seen such a heart-rending and tragic sight in my life before.</p>
<p>Question 19.<br />
Imagine that you are Lord Ullin. You bemoan and lament the tragic loss of your lovely daughter and curse yourself for having opposed her alliance with the chieftain. Express your feelings of pain and anguish in a letter to your friend.<br />
Answer:<br />
201, Market Street<br />
Aberdeen, Scotland<br />
20th March, 20XX<br />
Dear James<br />
They say what can’t be cured must be endured. But I had no patience and endurance. My beautiful daughter. Oh ! How much I loved her. She fell in love with the chieftain of Ulva island. The alliance was definitely not of my liking. The chieftain was no match to the honour and glory of our clan. Hence, I opposed her alliance with him. But the girl was passionately in love and eloped with him to escape my wrath. For three days they kept on running from one place to the other. I took my armed horsemen and gave them a hot chase. I had decided to kill the chieftain if he was caught alive. I came to know that he had taken a boat to reach over the ferry. My daughter was urging the boatman to row fast as she didn’t want to face my anger. At last, they were in our view. Soon the stormy waves engulfed the boat. I saw my daughter struggling and extending a hand for help. My anger turned into wailing. I assured to forgive them. But I was destined to see the most tragic sight in my life. My daughter lay dead with her one arm around her lover. Yours sincerely Ullin</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br />
Wednesday, 20th August, 20xx<br />
Dear Diary,<br />
I lament the day when my beloved daughter drowned with her lover the Chieftain of Ulva. I curse my rigidity and narrow-mindedness which cost me my daughter&#8217;s life. Love is natural and now I realize she did no wrong in falling in love with the Chieftain. But she should have thought about our tribe&#8217;s honour. She should not have eloped with the Chieftain. She should have taken us all in confidence and we would found out some way before the tragic end of my daughter. I curse myself that I opposed her alliance with the Chieftain out of anger and hard-heartedness. My heart comes out and this is not the grief of the chief of our tribe but that of a father. All fathers know how dear their children are to, them but it is all over now. I regret having put my soldiers behind her and the Chieftain. Instead, I should have valued the changing times and the changing values of our tribe. But now nothing can be done. We must think over such issues with an open heart and not deal with them with rigidity.<br />
Lord Ullin.</p>

Dear Diary,<br />
I witnessed a terrible sight today. Actually, we had been given orders by Lord Ullin to catch hold of chief of Ulva who had eloped with his daughter.We followed both of them. At last we reached the seashore after three days. We faced lots of problems on the way. To our horror we found that there was a wild seastorm.The water was reaching the skies. Very soon it was a different scene as the chieftain, Lord Ullin&#8217;s daughter and the boatman were drowned. Then I saw Lord Ullin wailing bitterly over the drowning of his beloved daughter.He Was raising his hands upwards towards the sty He was crying most piteously. Now Lord Ullin was not Lord Ullin but a helpless father seeing his own daughter drowning.The storm was violent and unabated. The scene was Very fearful. Seeing Lord Ullin lamenting over there, was the most piteous sight.I felt choked within as I could no longer see him wailing so piteously.</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br />
18th November, 20xx<br />
My dear Pearl,<br />
I hope you are well, perhaps you know that Lord Ullin&#8217;s daughter drowned with her lover, the Chieftain while crossing the Lochgyle in the ferry.It was really tragic that they drowned with the boatman in the terrible sea storm. Actually, Lord Ullin had sent his men after them with the orders for killing the lovers when they found them.Lord Ullin himself had been chasing them in his great anger. I feel great sympathy for the daughter. She had fallen in love with the Chieftain and I find it no crime. I am on the side of the lovers as love is divine and natural. This is really tragic that they had to die such a tragic death. They had not seen life as such. How cruel it was that they had to die in their youth? I am feeling greatly shocked and you may also be feeling the same. But we can do nothing about luck or destiny. However, this tragic incident can&#8217;t be forgotten.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Jenny.</p>

<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br />
Lord Ullin&#8217;s clan/tribe Scottish Moor Scotland<br />
20th August, 20xx<br />
My dear Lord Blen,<br />
Thank you for your letter sympathizing with me over the irreparable loss of my only daughter. I feel that I am responsible for her death at a personal level. But I couldn&#8217;t ignore my tribal or social responsibilities. I couldn&#8217;t allow her to marry the Chieftain of Ulva and so I issued orders to catch them. But the tragedy occurred.<br />
As the head of the clan, I followed the couple when they eloped. My men had orders to kill them wherever they were found. Me and my men found my daughter and her lover crossing the deadly Lochgyle seashore,They had not gone too far and could be saved if they had returned.The sea had already assumed demoniac shapes.The storm had become intense and deadly with water waves assuming ghost-like shapes.The sky was scowling. Seeing their death as imminent, my fatherly heart melted and I called out to them to return. I told them that I would forgive them if they returned safe and sound. But the couple didn&#8217;t heed my saying so and instead went ahead into the deadly sea. I saw them being enveloped in the stormy waves and soon they were drowned. I can&#8217;t forget the scene which claimed my daughter&#8217;s life. I shall regret it ever.<br />
Yours sincerely,<br />
Lord Ullin</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 6:</strong></span><br />
Who are the lovers? Why are they trying to escape and what happens to them in the end?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br />
The lovers are the Chief of Ulva&#8217;s Island and Lord Ullin&#8217;s lovely daughter. Their tribes are enemies to each other.<br />
So Lord Ullin has been pursuing the Chief of Ulva, his daughter&#8217;s lover. They are trying to escape from Lord Ullin&#8217;s men. They have orders to catch them and kill them. That&#8217;s why, the Chief of Ulva and his beloved ask the boatman for a favour.It is to ferry them across the stormy water without any more delay.The weather is really dark and stormy and looks menacing, but they also fear for their lives.While crossing the sea in the ferry, they drown in that bad weather</p>
<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 7:</strong></span><br />
What is a ballad? How is &#8216;Lord Ullin&#8217;s Daughter&#8217; a ballad?<br />

<p><span style="color: #eb4924;"><strong>Question 8:</strong></span><br />
What message does &#8216;Lord Ullin&#8217;s Daughter&#8217; convey to the readers?                                      <strong>(Value Based Question)</strong><br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span><br />
The poem &#8216;Lord Ullin&#8217;s Daughter&#8217; is a tragic story of two lovers who lost their lives for the sake of their love. It was due to the false ego and stubbornness of Lord Ullin which culminated in the drowning of the couple in the sea. This poem conveys the message that thoughtless and rash decisions can lead to disastrous results.<br />
Sometimes, ego of the parents leads to catastrophic results. Dictatorial parents do not try to understand the feelings of their young children. It gives rise to a conflict resulting from the clash of the rebellious nature of youth and the authority of parents. Vision and foresight can help prevent family breakups.</p>
