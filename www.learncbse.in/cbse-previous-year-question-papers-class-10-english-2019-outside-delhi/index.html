<h3>CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 English 2019 Outside Delhi Set-I</h3>
<p>SECTION &#8211; A<br />
(READING) 20</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [8]<br />
(1) Keep your watch accurate. For some people, moving up the time on their watch will help them get up earlier. For others, they will remember that the time on the watch is wrong and will disregard it altogether. It may be helpful to set your watch just two minutes ahead instead of five or ten.<br />
(2) Keep a clock, phone, computer or anything that displays time in each room of your house. One of the easiest ways to run late is simply by not realising that the time is passing as quickly as it is.<br />
(3) Set all your clocks and watches to the same time. Don&#8217;t be an optimist. Things usually take longer than what you&#8217;d expect, even without major delays. If you have a dinner appointement at 7:30 p.m., don&#8217;t think you can work till 7 p.m., then take a bath, dress and reach on time. Realistically, calculate the time you will take at each step and then add 10 minutes more to allow for unexpected delays, or you cannot get to your job in time.<br />
(4) Wake up when you are supposed to wake up. Don&#8217;t hit the snooze button, keep on lying in bed, and watch TV at the very start of your day. Maybe try even setting your clock 10 minutes earlier than you need. If you have difficulty with this, move your alarm clock to somewhere away from your bed; that way, you have to get up to turn it off. Commit yourself to being 15 minutes early for everything. If you have to reach your place of work at 8:00, don&#8217;t even tell yourself this. Just tell yourself (and everyone else who listens- but don&#8217;t annoy them or make them think that they are late or early!) &#8220;I have to be at work at 7.45&#8221;. If you do this, you willl be on time even with little unforeseen delays. You will be on time even with a traffic jam.</p>
<p>Question 1.1.<br />
Complete the following statements using words/phrases from the passage. Attempt any eight. [1 × 8 = 8]<br />
(a) Some people believe that if &#8230;.. it will help them be earlier.<br />
(b) Many others know &#8230;.. they disregard it altogether.<br />
(c) Keep &#8230;&#8230; in each room.<br />
(d) One of the things that can be done is &#8230;&#8230; of five or ten minutes.<br />
(e) Many a time we do not realise that &#8230;&#8230;<br />
(f) Instead of pressing the snooze button &#8230;&#8230;<br />
(g) If you have difficulty in getting up &#8230;&#8230;.<br />
(h) It is a good habit to &#8230;&#8230;. somewhere away from your bed.<br />
(i) It is good to commit yourself &#8230;&#8230; for every thing.<br />

<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : [12]<br />
1. Music is perhaps the most popular and widely practised form of Fine Arts, transcending all kinds of cultural and linguistic barriers. Any form of fine art is difficult to master and almost impossible to perfect and music is no exception.<br />
2. Nature, it is learnt, has blessed almost two- thirds of the human race with musical ability of some sort. Music has the power to bring out the deepest emotions. It can make one cry or bring a smile on one&#8217;s face. In fact it is a magic medicine and many seek refuge in it when they are depressed or stressed. It is this intimacy that makes us listen to music or even hum or sing sometimes. This singing, or realistically speaking, expressing one&#8217;s emotion musically sometimes takes a serious turn. This desire to show musical expression in public then becomes a serious business profession. And from here the musical journey begins.<br />
3. This desire to sing before an audience is innocent and beautiful and indeed it is perfectly alright to have such a genuine desire. But it is also important to understand that, singing is an intricate art — a highly refined one at that, which requires systematic, prolonged and strict training, to be acceptable. This is an aspect we forget in our keen desire to reach the stage and perform. It is almost like preparing a formal meal for some specially invited guests, without even having learnt and trained in the basics of cooking. This is why we have more noise and less music nowadays.<br />
4. These days almost everyone sings and it does not stop here. Most of us want to become professional singers, Result : a complete disregard for and ignorance of the<br />
training part, as the need is never felt to go through one and the urge to get to the stage and perform overcomes even a little desire to learn, if any. If at all, somewhere along the way one feels the need to gain some knowledge and training, it leads to hurried shortcuts and half-hearted attempts, best described as &#8216;Crash Courses&#8217;.<br />
5. It is observed that those who have attained the so called partial success, suddenly feel that they lack the required knowledge and are not learned enough. But it is too late by then. It should be understood here that the stage or a performance brings in a different mindset within the artist. It is always recommended and rightly said, that while on stage, cover the mistakes and weaknesses if any, and get along. But the contrary is true when it comes to acquiring knowledge and during the learning process. While under training, the student is expected to make mistakes but then rectify those mistakes under the supervision and guidance of the teacher. Therefore, it is good to make mistakes and then be corrected during the process of learning as this subsequently makes one flawless and educated. This is a different mindset. And these two mindsets discussed above, (those of a performer and that of a student) cannot co-exist.</p>

PROBLEM OF TRAFFIC JAMS IN METROPOLITAN CITIES<br />
By Renu/Rajan<br />
The country&#8217;s automobile industry has been growing rapidly with the increase in per capita income, the consequence of which is excessive load on roads due to steadily increasing number of vehicles in the metropolitan cities. Traffic jams occur when vehicles in large numbers come to a standstill for any reason for a certain period of time. There is not a single day when the roads in the metro cities are without chaos. Another reason for the traffic congestion is the overgrowing population as well as the increase in the number of private, public and commercial vehicles. It occurs mostly during peak hours when people commute to or fro from their workplaces and hence, they face inconvenience. It is an absolute wastage of their productive time. Distances have also increased in a way. Where it used to take only few minutes to cover certain distances earlier, now takes hours to cover the same. People get stranded in their vehicles for hours and get late for their offices, business meetings or any other appointments. Heavy traffic creates problems not only for the vehicle drivers but also for pedestrians. Pedestrians find it difficult to walk on the sideways meant for them. Traffic congestion has become a menace for the injured or seriously ill patients who sometimes die on their way due to traffic jams. There are also chances of road mishaps as vehicles move in close proximity to each other.</p>
<p>It is therefore, necessary to start an awareness campaign to lighten the burden on roads and to take various measures to control traffic jams in metro cities.</p>

TIT FOR TAT<br />
Mukesh, the grocer, was very greedy. He would mix stones in pulses and coloured sand in spices and sell them to the poor villagers. The villagers complained to him but he turned a deaf ear to them, as his was the only grocery store in the village. The villagers, then decided to teach him a lesson. They all gathered and went to the king to make a complaint against him. On hearing this the king became very angry and ordered his courtiers to summon him to the court. When Mukesh was brought to the court, the king rebuked him saying, &#8220;You have been cheating the innocent villagers for the past so many months and for this, you will be punished&#8221;. The grocer was frightened and asked for forgiveness. The king gave him the relaxation of choosing his punishment. The king asked him either to get ready to go beaten a thousand times or eat one hundred onions at a time. The grocer became happy thinking it to be an easy punishment and chose to eat onions. But having eaten only 20 onions, tears rolled down his eyes and he asked to be beaten. When guards started lashing him and the count reached to 50, Mukesh cried with pain and knelt down before the king feeling extremely sorry for his deeds. He promised not to cheat anyone in future. The king released him on a warning and Mukesh lived the life of an honest person thereafter.<br />

THE SCARY NIGHT<br />
It was 10 p.m. I was alone at home. Suddenly, I heard a knock on the door. I expected no one at that hour of time as all my family members had gone to attend a close family wedding whereas I was supposed to stay at home due to my board exams. Repeated knocking at the door scared me to death. A chill went down my spine. Suddenly, the lights went off and this only worsened my fear. Then I saw some shadows outside the window. My heartbeat increased as it was dense dark outside, and I couldn&#8217;t imagine in my wildest thoughts who could be there. I geared up, gathered courage and reached the window. Slowly I pulled the curtains and looked outside but the shadow was not clear at all and it was not a single shadow but four or five shadows. This was enough for me to believe that some scoundrels were there at the door. I looked for my cricket bat, held it tightly and reached for the main door of the living room. Although it was cold winter, I was still down with sweat. With a sudden jerk, I opened the door and lifted my bat to hit but I was surprised to see that it was my family members who had come early because of me. I felt relieved and embraced my mother tightly. That night I slept with my parents, holding my mother&#8217;s hand. It was really a scary night!<br />

(d) Ebright&#8217;s mother motivated him to leam. She was his only childhood friend and a companion. She used to take him on trips, buy scientific equipments like microscopes, telescopes, cameras, etc. and help him in many ways. She introduced him to Dr. Fredrick A. Urquhart of the University of Toronto, Canada. She found many interesting things for him to leam.<br />

Answer :<br />
Mme Forestier proved to be a true friend of Loisels. Mme Forestier played a crucial role in the story. She helped Mathilde when Mathilde needed her genuinely. Mathilde was blessed with a beautiful physique but she lacked the lavish lifestyle she yearned for. Therefore, she was discontented with her life. Although Mme Forestier treated her kindly, Mathilde was jealous of Mme Forestier because of her wealth. Once, Mathilde had to attend a fancy party so she borrowed a diamond necklace from Mme Forestier. Forestier was immediately ready to lend Mathilde the necklace. In fact, she displayed the entire array of her jewels in front of her and asked her to choose from them. She didn&#8217;t show any urgency to get back the necklace and when Mathilde returned the necklace, Mme Forestier didn&#8217;t even inspect it. It shows her honest nature. She also felt bad when Mathilde suffered unnecessarily to pay for a replacement necklace. Thus, she proved to be her genuine friend.<br />

Kisa Gotami was a young woman who belonged to a wealthy family. She was married to a merchant. When her one-year old child fell ill and died, she was grief- stricken and couldn&#8217;t bear his death. She took her dead child in her arms and went door to door begging everyone to tell the way to get her child back to life. Nobody helped her and instead thought her to be crazy but she didn&#8217;t give up. Then she came across a Buddhist who suggested her to meet Buddha as only he could help him. That&#8217;s why Gotami went to Buddha. Buddha taught her the lesson of life and truth. When she told Buddha the whole story, he listened to it with patience and asked her to collect mustard seeds from a house where no one had ever died. She went from house to house but she couldn&#8217;t find a single house where no one had ever died. Ultimately, she understood what Buddha had been trying to explain her that suffering is inevitable and in this way, she realized that death is the ultimate truth and one has to meet his destined end one day, no one can avoid it. So, she took her child away and became Buddha&#8217;s follower.</p>

Sub : Suggestions on ways to improve the facilities for tourists<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I would like to highlight the issues of dissatisfactory tourists&#8217; facilities in Jaipur and wish to give my suggestions in this regard.<br />
It is a world known fact that Rajasthan is one of the best tourists&#8217; destinations in India and its capital Jaipur fascinates all foreigners immensly. But there are certain areas which need a lot of improvement. First and the foremost suggestion is related to the signboards places. As we know that foreigners don&#8217;t understand the local dialect the signboards and the direction boards should be both in Hindi and English. Another suggestion is regarding the cleanliness near the temples. Jaipur is popularly known as &#8216;Choti Kashi&#8217; and the famous Govind Dev Ji temple is visited by almost each and every tourist here. But there is a lot of chaos around the temple area. The hawkers, peddlars and fruit sellers have made the area congested and filthy. The queue system is also out of place and it portrays a negative picture of the city. Thus, management should take certain steps in this regard. Then comes the question of forts. The magnificently built forts should be senior citizen friendly and there should be provision of lifts and wheelchairs for handicaps. My last suggestion is about the conditions of buses which is pathetic. Improved bus services would attract more tourists.<br />
I hope my suggestions would find place in your newspaper and can be incorporated so that the tourism sector can be improved. Thanking You Yours Faithfully Hemant/Hema<br />

AVOID PLAYING LOUD MUSIC WHILE DRIVING<br />
By Tarun/Tanvi<br />
While reading the newspaper, I came across an advertisement advising the motorists not to play loud music while driving. This advertisement caught my attention and I felt that the need of the hour is to spread awareness amongst the people against it. Nowadays, listening to loud music while driving has become fashionable among people, especially youngsters, but they don&#8217;t know the harmful consequences of it. For their own entertainment, these people turn deaf ear to others&#8217; problems. It not only affects the public and residents of the colony but the patients and children too. Loud music has become a constant source of nuisance. When loud music is being played near hospitals, patients lose their peaceful sleep and they become restless. The high volume of the music has disrupted everyone&#8217;s tranquility. Students fail to concentrate upon their studies and during examinations, they face great difficulty due to it. Moreover, there are cases of deafness, insomnia, palpitation of heart, mental fatigue etc. and among the sufferers are majorly small babies and old people.The problem further adds to the fact that noise control laws are neither followed properly nor implemented completely.<br />
So I think that law alone is not sufficient until and unless we all take oath to make the city noise-free by educating the people about its ill effects. Everyone who plays loud music while driving, should refrain from doing so.</p>

THE WOODCUTTER AND THE AXE<br />
A woodcutter earned his living by cutting wood from the jungle and selling it in the market. One day when he was cutting down a tree on the bank of a river, his axe fell into the river. He was shocked to see that because the axe was his only source of earning. The river was deep enough and the poor woodcutter didn&#8217;t know how to swim. He sat there weeping. For hours he kept waiting for someone to help him but no one turned up. Then an unusual thing happened. A beautiful elf from the river appeared before the woodcutter. She asked him &#8220;Why are you not chopping the wood ?&#8221; The woodcutter sadly replied, &#8220;My axe has fallen into the river and I don’t know how to swim. Now I can&#8217;t cut wood&#8221;. The elf then showed him a golden axe and asked him &#8220;Is this your axe which had fallen into the river ?&#8221; The woodcutter saw the axe carefully and replied, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not my axe&#8221;. The elf disappeared and after some time reappeared with a silver axe. She again asked the woodcutter, &#8220;Is this the axe you are looking for?&#8221; The woodcutter checked the axe again and said,&#8221; No, it&#8217;s not my axe. My axe is made up of iron and has a wooden handle&#8221;. This time the elf showed him his original axe and seeing that the woodcutter exclaimed with joy,&#8221; Yes, that&#8217;s my axe!&#8221; The honesty of the woodcutter made the elf very happy and she gave him both the gold and silver axes as his reward. The woodcutter accepted the gifts and returned home thrilled and overjoyed. He told the whole incident to wife who also appreciated his honesty and thereafter they both lived happily.<br />

My mother woke me up and told me that my grandmother had been seriously ill. She was gasping and sweating profusely. My mother was horrified and perplexed to see this. She couldn&#8217;t understand what had happened to the grandmother. She didn&#8217;t know what to do so she cried for help. My father was not at home that time. He had gone out of the town for a week for some official work. I was all alone with my mother, younger sister and grandmother. Nobody had ever imagined that anything like that would happen. Fortunately, our next door neighbour had returned home early as he had to attend some party that day. When he heard my mother shouting for help, he came running to our house. He saw my grandmother and immediately understood # her condition. Without a moment&#8217;s delay, ’ he took out his car, put my grandmother in it and rushed to the nearby hospital. Meanwhile his wife took me and my sister to her house, calmed us down and fed us properly. Doctors examined her and told that she had a mild heart attack and the slightest delay would have turned out to be dangerous for her. Next morning my grandmother was discharged after getting medical prescriptions and we took her back home. It was the happiest moment for all of us and we were grateful to our neighbours for because of whom we could see our grandmother alive. Then, I was all ready to receive the trophy but more than that, I was happy to have my grandmother back. It was the best trophy that I ever received in my life.</p>

<p>Sub: III effects of synthetic milk on health and suggestions to deal with it.</p>
<p>Sir,<br />
This is with reference to a news report which I read yesterday, regarding the adulteration of milk with urea and other chemicals. It has greatly disturbed me as we have been hearing the increased cases of unique diseases daily which were never heard of earlier. They are the consequence of the adulterated food products. Synthetic milk which contains the amount of urea, caustic soda, detergents and cheap cooking oils, increases the risk of heart problems. It is also harmful for pregnant ladies. Moreover, synthetic milk possesses cancerous properties and many people have been affected by it till date. Children are the biggest sufferers as their immune system is weak at a young age. The sodium that enters the body through the synthetic milk acts as a slow poison.<br />
During the festival seasons, the increased cases of adulterated milk have come into light as the demand for milk increases to prepare sweets and other delicacies. Therefore, I suggest that the Health Department should keep a strict vigilance on these unscrupulous milk dealers and police should raid the milk factories from time to time. Food Safety and Standards Act prescribes maximum six months in prison for the offence and this should be taken into practice for sure. The Supreme Court has also advised the states to make the adulteration of milk a punishable offence. Thus, if these steps are followed strictly, I think the cases of milk adulteration will definitely reduce.<br />
Thanking You<br />
Yours Faithfully<br />

THE ROLE OF THE STUDENTS IN<br />
ACHIEVING 100% LITERACY<br />
By Mohan/Mohini<br />
Youth plays a vital role in the development of any country and one cannot deny their importance in the upliftment of a nation. India is a land of villages and most of its population is illiterate. In many villages, there are no schools or teaching facilities. Thus, villagers don&#8217;t get any opportunity to learn. Poverty and ignorance have deprived them from becoming literate. They don&#8217;t even know how to write their name or recognize the alphabets. The villagers are bound by the superstitions and it is necessary to remove these beliefs from their minds. Therefore, it becomes the duty of the youth to render their services to them by teaching them. They can give their valuable advice and guidance to educate ’ them. The government has also started a campaign &#8216;Each one, Teach One&#8217; to facilitate the learning programme for the illiterates. So anyone who wants to participate in this campaign can get their names enrolled. I think it is a very good initiative by the government. The students are the only ones who can change the mindset of the illiterates and transform them. They can easily teach them using innovative techniques which would help them in many things such as their farming process. The students could make groups among themselves and start teaching the illiterate people in their respective areas. With the increase in the population, the responsibilities of students have also increased. Their role in teaching people is now full of challenges and they can possibly achieve 100% literacy in the country by making revolutionary changes.</p>

Answer:<br />
A FEARFUL INCIDENT<br />
It was raining heavily, the street lights had gone off and I was alone, coming back from my tuition class. It was 8 p.m. and very cold. Suddenly, I heard some footsteps behind me. I stopped and looked behind but saw no one. I started walking again and then, I heard the footsteps again. This time it scared me. The road was lonely and in that rainy night, I could hardly see a person or two on the sideways. I neither had an umbrella nor a raincoat as I couldn&#8217;t think of the possibility of rain that day. I imagined who it could be? a watchman returning home after his duty or a criminal following me for some purpose? Mere thought of the latter aroused my goosebumps. I dared not to see back and instead increased my walking speed. But what! The footsteps behind me were also heard walking rapidly. I prayed silently to God to help me. In my fear, I followed the wrong path. I thought of screaming for help but now no one was there. The whole road was deserted because the road which I had taken went towards the isolated industrial area and the workers might have gone to their houses by then. I started running fast and the footsteps behind me also started running fast. I was almost on the verge of fainting when the voice from behind held my breath. I mustered up the courage and turned back. I saw a tall man, wearing a long raincoat and a hat, moving towards me. In a stem voice he asked me stop and I stopped! When he came closer to me, I saw his face. He was a policeman who was doing his night duty. He asked me the reason for running as he suspected me to be a criminal. I explained him that I was returning back home from tuition and showed him my tuition register and books as proof. When he was satisfied with the answer, he escorted me to the house and went away.<br />
OR<br />
A FIERY EXPERIENCE<br />
One day I was sleeping in my room. Suddenly I had difficulty breathing. On waking up I found smoke coming into my room. I got up and opened my window. Peeping out, I saw a big fire which broke out in the busy commercial complex in front of my house. Without wasting a second, I rang up the fire brigade and informed the police too. The security guard was shouting at the top of his voice. Everyone came out of their houses. The fire started spreading fast and the worst thing that happened was the wind which started blowing at the same moment. It made the fire more tyrannous. Many people got trapped in the fire. I joined the others in the rescue work. Soon the police and firemen arrived and began doing their job. The police quickly evacuated the area and the firemen got engaged in fighting the fire. It nearly took one and a half hour to extinguish the fire. It was actually very difficult to evacuate the people trapped in the leaping flames. Fortunately, there was no harm to any life although goods worth lakhs were destroyed and turned into ashes. Later on, it was discovered that the fire broke out due to short circuit that had sparked off the fire in one of the shops in the complex. If there was no quick action taken by the firemen, policemen and security guards, anything hazardous could have happened.<br />
That day, I understood the true value of our helpers and how they carry out their duties. Everyone&#8217;s job is equally important and we should never underestimate any work as no work is small. I salute these brave people who render their services to help others by putting their own lives at risk.<br />
Moral &#8211; Always value the services rendered to us by the helpers&#8217;</p>
