<li>Were they aware only of their differences or did they also naturally share friendships and experiences? (Think of the bedtime stories in Kalam’s house; of who his friends were ; and of what used to take place in the pond near his house.)</li>
<li>The author speaks both of people who were very aware of the differences among them and those who tried to bridge these differences. Can you identify such people in the text?</li>
<li>Narrate two incidents that show how differences can be created, and also how they can be resolved. How can people change their attitudes?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>The author talks about the people who belong to various castes and follow various religious preachings. Yes, these groups were easily identifiable. Their dressing, traditions, culture and rituals were different.</li>
<li>They did share their personal experiences and friendships. Lakshmana Sastry summoned the teacher who separated the author and his friend in the class and told him that he should not spread the poison of social inequality and communal intolerance in the minds of innocent children.</li>
<li>The school teacher encouraged communal differences and Lakshmana Sastry and Sivasubramania Iyer discouraged this malpractice.</li>
<li>The influential people can do both the things. A teacher has the ability to bridge communal differences and can play with sentiments of the innocent and ignorant people. This is what the new teacher did. But the Science teacher Sivasubramania Iyer changed his wife’s attitude and showed her the right path.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 2.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why did Abdul Kalam want to leave Rameswaram?</li>
<li>What did his father say to this?</li>
<li>What do you think his words mean? Why do you think he spoke those words?</li>
</ol>
<p>Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>Abdul Kalam wanted to leave Rameswaram to study at the district headquarters in Ramanathapuram.</li>
<li>His father said that he knew he had to go away to grow. He gave the example of a seagull and said that a seagull flies across the sun alone and without a nest.</li>
<li>He spoke these words because he intended to hone his skills. He knew the harsh reality of life that children may have to live far from their parents to make their career and earn their livelihood. So he showed his wisdom and intelligence in uttering these words.</li>

To Sir, with Love</p>
<p>1. From Rameswaram to the Rashtrapati Bhavan, it’s been a long journey. Talking to Nona Walia on the eve of Teacher’s Day, President Dr. A.PJ. Abdul Kalam talks about life’s toughest lessons learnt and his mission—being a teacher to the Indian Youth. “A proper education would help nurture a sense of dignity and self-respect among our youth”, says President Kalam. There’s still a child in him though, and he’s still curious about learning new things. Life’s a mission for President Kalam.</p>
<p>2. Nonetheless, he remembers his first lesson in life and how it changed his destiny. “I was studying in Standard V, and must have been all of 10. My teacher, Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was telling us how birds fly. He drew a diagram of a bird on the blackboard, depicting the wings, tail and the body with the head and then explained how birds soar to the sky. At the end of the class, I said I didn’t understand. Then he asked the other students if they had understood, but nobody had understood how birds fly,” he recalls.</p>
<p>3. “That evening, the entire class was taken to Rameswaram shore” the President continues. “My teacher showed us sea birds. We saw marvellous formations of them flying and how their wings flapped. Then my teacher asked us, ‘Where is the birds’ engine and how is it powered?’ I knew then that birds are powered by their own life and motivation. I understood all about birds’ dynamics. This was real teaching—a theoretical lesson coupled with a live practical example. Sri Sivasubramania Iyer was a great teacher. ” That day, my future was decided. My destiny was changed. I knew my future had to be about flight and flight systems.<br />

In my opinion, the fundamental goal of education is to help a learner in opting for a perfect stream and assist him in earning his livelihood.<br />

<p>Question 1.<br />
Think and write a short account of what life in Rameswaram in the 1940s must have been like. (Were people rich or poor? Hard working or lazy? Hopeful of change, or resistant to it?).<br />
Answer:<br />
The people of Rameswaram in 1940s were orthodox and tolerant. It is mentioned in the story that every child is bom into a specific socio-economic and emotional environment and trained in certain ways by figures of authority. The people of Rameswaram were not ready to allow anybody to instigate their children on the basis of communal intolerance. They were all religious people and did not like to enjoy the luxuries of life. They had pucca houses made of limestone and brick. They used to avoid all inessential comforts and were emotionally attached to the members of their family.</p>

</strong>How did Abdul Kalam earn his &#8220;first wages&#8221; ? How did he feel at that time ?<strong>(Board Term 1,2012, ELI-024)</strong><br />
Answer:<br />
Kalam was only 8 years old when the second world war broke out in 1939. Then there was a great demand for tamarind seeds. Abdul used to collect those seeds and sell them in the market. His cousin Shamsuddin distributed newspapers. The train would not stop at Rameshwaram and the bundles of newspapers were thrown from the running train. Abdul was employed by his cousin to collect them. This way he earned his first wages. He felt very proud on earning his first wage.</p>
<p>Question 4:<strong><br />
</strong>&#8220;Once you decide to change the system, such problems have to be confronted.&#8221; What system is being refer in the sentence from the chapter &#8220;My Childhood&#8221;? What are such problems ?<strong>(Board Term 1,2012, ELI-025)</strong><br />
Answer:<br />
System means system of discrimination on the basis of religion. The system includes the narrow-mindedness and poison of social inequality and communal intolerance. The Brahmins did not allow Muslims to enter their kitchen. The science teacher &#8211; a rebel by nature, invited Kalam to his home and proved that if one is determined to face problems and change the system, he will definitely succeed. Though, such indifferences come in everybody&#8217;s life but a person should have a broader outlook and overcome the obstacles.</p>
<p>Question 5:<strong><br />
</strong>How was the Science teacher Siva Subramaniam Iyer, though an orthodox. Brahmin with a very conservative wife, a friend of Abdul Kalam. Give incidents to support your answer.<strong>(Board Term 1,2012, ELI-025)</strong><br />
Answer:<br />
The Science teacher, Siva Subramaniam Iyer, wanted to break the social barriers between the Hindus and the Muslims. He wanted Kalam to be very highly educated as he recognized his intelligence. One day, he invited him over to a meal. His orthodox wife was totally horrified at the idea of a Muslim boy dining in her ritually pure kitchen. He did not mind anything said by his very conservative wife. He rather served the food to Abdul by his own hands. He also sat with him and dined together as well as invited him over again for another meal the coming weekend. Thus, this shows that he was a friend of Abdul Kalam even though Kalam was a Muslim and he himself was an orthodox Brahmin.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Value Based Question (4 marks)</strong></p>

</strong>&#8216;Childhood&#8217; is the formative period of a child&#8217;s life. The lessons learnt here always stays with a person. Comment on it in the light of the lesson A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.<br />
Answer:<br />
A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is one of the finest scientists in our country and was also our eleventh President. From his autobiography &#8220;Wings of Fire&#8221; it is amply clear that lessons learnt in our childhood not only shape our personality but also decide the kind of person we become. He learnt the lessons of religious tolerance, honesty and self-discipline early in his life. These qualities stayed with him throughout his life and have helped to make him one of the finest President of our country with so many diverse cultures.</p>
