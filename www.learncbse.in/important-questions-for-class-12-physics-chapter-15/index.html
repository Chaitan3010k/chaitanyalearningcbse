<h4>Communication Systems Class 12 Important Questions Very Short Answer Type</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What is sky wave propagation? (Delhi 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
Propagation of frequencies less than 40 MHz using the reflecting property of ionosphere is called Sky wave propagation.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What is ground wave propagation? (Delhi 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
A radiowave that can travel directly from one point to another following the surface of the earth is called a ground wave propagation. Ground wave propagation is possible only when the transmitting and receiving antenna are close to the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What is space wave propagation? (Delhi 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
When the signal travels in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna with frequencies more than 40 MHz, it is called space-wave propagation. Space waves are used for line of sight (LOS) communication as well as satellite communication.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What is the function of a repeater used in communication system? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
The function of a repeater in communication system is to extend the range of communication.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What does the term &#8216;attenuation&#8217; used in communication system mean? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Attenuation used in communication system means loss of strength of a signal during its propagation through the communication channel.</p>
<p>Question 6.<br />
What is the function of a transducer used in a communication system? (Comptt. Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Transducer : Any device/arrangement that converts one form of energy into another is called a transducer.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
The carrier wave is given by C(t) = 2 sin (8πt) volt<br />

<p>Question 44.<br />
What is sky wave communication? Why is this mode of propagation restricted to the frequencies only upto few MHz? (All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
Sky wave communication : A radiowave directed towards the sky and reflected by the ionosphere . towards the desired location of the earth is called a sky wave. The ionospheric layers act as a reflector for a certain range of frequencies. Radio waves of frequencies between 3 MHz to 30 MHz can be reflected by the ionosphere. This mode of propagation is used by short wave broadcast service.</p>
<p>The propagation is restricted to the electro-magnetic waves of frequencies greater than 30 MHz because they penetrate the ionosphere and escape.</p>

<p>Question 58.<br />
Explain briefly how ground waves are propagated? Why can&#8217;t this mode be used for long distance using high frequency?<br />
(Comptt. All India 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
When the radiowaves from the transmission antenna propagate along surface of the earth, so as to reach the receiving antena, these are known as ground waves propagation.<br />
Ground waves are rapidly attenuated due to scattering by the curved surface of earth. It is why these cannot be used for long distances.</p>
<p>Question 59.<br />
Explain briefly how sky waves are propagated. Why are sky waves not used for transmission of TV signals? (Comptt. All India 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
Sky wave propagation. When the radio-waves from the transmitting antenna reach the receiving antenna after reflection in the ionosphere, the wave propaga-tion is called sky wave propagation.</p>
<p>Sky waves are not used in transmitting TV signals because of high frequency (&gt; 80 MHz). These waves are not reflected back by the ionosphere and . penetrate into outer space.</p>
<p>Question 60.<br />
Describe briefly the space wave mode of propagation. Name one transmission which uses space wave mode. (Comptt. All India 2013)<br />
Answer:<br />
Space wave propagation. When the radio-waves from the transmitting antenna reach the receiving antenna either directly or after reflection from the ground or in the troposphere, the wave propagation is called space wave propagation.</p>
<p>In practice, direct wave mode is more dominant. However, it is limited to the so called &#8216;line-of-sight&#8217; transmission distances and curvature of earth as well as height of antenna restrict the extent of coverage.<br />
TV transmission uses the space wave mode.</p>

(ii) Demodulator. It is the set-up which makes the process of retrival of information from the carrier wave at the receiver. It is the reverse of &#8216;modulator&#8217;</p>
<p>Question 64.<br />
Explain the terms<br />
(i) Attenuation and<br />
(ii) Demodulation used in communication system. (Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) The loss of strength of a signal while propagating through a medium is called &#8216;Attenuation&#8217;.<br />
(ii) The process of separation of information signal from modulated wave at the receving end is called &#8216;Demodulation&#8217;.</p>
<p>Question 65.<br />
Define modulation index. Why is it kept low? What is the role of a bandpass filter? (All India 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Modulation index is the ratio of the amplitude of modulating signal to that of carrier wave and is given by \(\mu=\frac{A_{m}}{A_{c}}\)<br />
(ii) It is kept low to avoid distortion.<br />
(iii) Role of bandpass filter is that it rejects low and high frequencies and allows a band of frequencies to pass through.</p>

<p>Question 76.<br />
(i) Why is communication using line of sight mode limited to frequencies above 40 MHz?<br />
(ii) A transmitting antenna at the top of a tower has a height 32 m and the height of the receiving antenna is 50 m. What is the maximum distance between them for satisfactory communication in line of sight mode? (Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) It is evident that above 40 MHz frequencies, the size of transmitting and receiving antenna reduces and has to be placed at a sufficient . height from the ground. Whereas below this<br />
frequency, the waves from transmitting antenna get interrupted and blocked at many points by curvature of earth.<br />
(ii) Given : h<sub>T</sub> = 32 m, h<sub>R</sub> = 50 m,<br />
R = 6400 = 64 × 10<sup>5</sup> m<br />
Maximum line of sight distance dm between the transmitting antenna and receiving antenna is given by<br />

<p>Question 79.<br />
Write briefly any two factors which demonstrate the need for modulating a signal.<br />
Draw a suitable diagram to show amplitude modulation using a sinusoidal signal as the modulating signal. (All India 2011)<br />
Answer:<br />
Need for modulation :<br />
(i) Audio frequencies below 20 kHz are poor to radiate. They die out after covering small distance in air. Hence they cannot travel large distance from the point of transmission.<br />
(ii) To transmit audio waves, a very small antenna is needed. For example, if a 15 kHz signal is to be broadcasted then it requires a vertical antenna of heights 5 km which is impossible to think even.<br />

<p>Question 80.<br />
Write any three factors which justify the need for modulating a signal.<br />
Draw a diagram showing an amplitude modulated wave by superposing a modulating signal over a sinusoidal carrier wave. (Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Need for modulation:<br />
(i) Size of an tenna: For transmitting a signal, an antennaa or an aerial of a practical size comparable to the wavelength of the signal is required. If 15 kHz signal is to be broadcasted then it requires a vertical antenna of height 5 km which is impossible to even think off.</p>
<p>(ii) Effective power radiated by an antenna: Audio frequencies are below 20 kHz. The low frequencies are poor to radiate. They die out after covering small distance in air. For good transmission, high powers and high frequency transmission is needed.</p>
<p>(iii) Mixing up of signals from different transmitters : If many transmitters are transmitting message signals simultaneously, all these signals will get mixed up and it will be difficult to distinguish between them.<br />

<p>Question 81.<br />
Name the three different modes of propagation of electromagnetic waves. Explain, using a proper diagram the mode of propagation used in the frequency range above 40 MHz. (Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
The modes of propagation of electromagnetic waves are :<br />
(i) Ground waves<br />
(ii) Sky waves<br />
(iii) Space waves<br />
Above 40 MHz, the mode of propagation used is via space waves. A space wave travels in a straight line from the transmitting antenna to the receiving antenna. Space waves are used for line of sight (LOS) communications as well as satellite communication.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114473" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-57.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 15 Communication Systems Class 12 Important Questions 57" width="319" height="266" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-57.png 319w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-57-300x250.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px" /></p>
<p>Question 82.<br />
Mention three different modes of propagation used in communication system. Explain with the help of a diagram how long distance communication can be achieved by ionospheric reflection of radio waves. (All India 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Three different modes of propagation used in communication are :<br />
(i) Space wave propagation.<br />
(ii) Ground wave propagation<br />
(iii) Sky wave or ionospheric propagation<br />
The radio waves of the high frequency band having frequency range 3-30 MHz cannot penetrate through the ionosphere. They are reflected back towards the earth. This region of the AM band is called short wave band. Above 40 MHz, the ionosphere bends the electromagnetic waves and does not reflect them back towards the earth.<br />

<p>Question 83.<br />
Explain briefly the following terms used in communication system :<br />
(i) Transducer<br />
(ii) Repeater<br />
(iii) Amplification (All India 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Transducer: Any device which converts energy from one form to another is called a transducer. We may define an electrical transducer as a device which converts variation in physical quantity such as pressure, displacement, force, temperature etc., into corresponding variations in the electrical signal at its output.</p>
<p>(ii) Repeater: As signal while passing through the transmission medium may get attenuated due to the various energy losses along its path. So a signal booster or amplifying repeater is placed at suitable distance along its path. A repeater is a combination of a transmitter, an amplifier and a receiver which picks up a signal from the transmitter, amplifiers and retransmits it to the receiver sometimes with a change of carrier frequency.</p>
<p>(iii) Amplification : It is the process of increasing the amplitude and hence the strength of an electrical signal by using a suitable electric circuit (consisting of atleast one transistor) is called the amplifier.</p>
<p>Question 84.<br />
(a) Distinguish between sinusoidal and pulse-shaped signals.<br />
(b) Explain, showing graphically, how a sinu-soidal carrier wave is superimposed on a modulating signal to obtain the resultant amplitude modulated (AM) wave. (Comptt. All India 2012)<br />

When a modulating signal (Figure b) is superimposed on sinusoidal carrier wave (Figure a), and as a result, the amplitude of the carrier wave varies in accordance with the modulating signal, the resultant wave (Figure c) is known as an amplitude modulated wave.</p>
<p>Question 85.<br />
Write three important factors which justify the need of modulating a message signal. Show diagrammatically how an amplitude modulated wave is obtained when a modulating signal is superimposed on a carrier wave. (Delhi 2013)<br />

<p>(iii) E-mail : E-maii (Electronic mail) is a method of exchanging digital messages from an author to one or more recipients. E-mail operates across the internet or other complex networks. E-mail servers accept, forward, deliver and store messages.</p>
<p>An internet Email message consists of these components :<br />
(a) message envelope,<br />
(b) message header and<br />
(c) message body. Thus e-mail is an information and communications technology.</p>
<p>Question 98.<br />
(a) Explain any two factors which justify the need of modulating a low frequency signal.<br />
(b) Write two advantages of frequency modulation over amplitude modulation. (Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Need of modulation : A low frequency signal is modulated for the following purposes :<br />
(i) It reduces the wavelength of transmitted signal, and the minimum height of antenna for effective communication is \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\).<br />
Therefore height of antenna becomes practically achievable.</p>
<p>(ii) Power radiated into the space by an antenna is inversely proportional to λ<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, the power radiated into the space increases and signal can travel larger distance.</p>
<p>(b) Advantages of frequency modulation :</p>
<ol>
<li>High efficiency</li>
<li>Less noise .</li>
<li>Maximum use of transmitted power.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 99.<br />
(i) Which mode of propagation is used by shortwave broadcast services having frequency range from a few MHz upto 30 MHz? Explain diagrammatically how long distance communication can be achieved by this mode.<br />
(ii) Why is there an upper limit to frequency of waves used in this mode? (All India 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) (a) Sky wave propagation<br />
(b)<br />
Three different modes of propagation used in communication are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Space wave propagation.</li>
<li>Ground wave propagation</li>
<li>Sky wave or ionospheric propagation</li>
</ol>
<p>The radio waves of the high frequency band having frequency range 3-30 MHz cannot penetrate through the ionosphere. They are reflected back towards the earth. This region of the AM band is called shortwave band. Above 40 MHz, the ionosphere bends the electromagnetic waves and does not reflect them back towards the earth.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114474" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-58.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 15 Communication Systems Class 12 Important Questions 58" width="276" height="141" /></p>
<p>(ii) Electromagnetic waves of frequencies higher than 30 MHz, penetrate the ionosphere and escape whereas the waves less than 30 MHz are reflected back to the earth by the ionosphere.</p>
<p>Question 100.<br />
What does the term &#8216;Modulation&#8217;, used in communication system, mean?<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-114489" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-72.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 15 Communication Systems Class 12 Important Questions 72" width="430" height="256" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-72.png 430w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-15-Communication-Systems-Class-12-Important-Questions-72-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" /><br />
Identify the two types of modulation shown here. Give two advantages of any one of these over the other. (Comptt. Delhi 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Modulation is a process in which one of the characteristics (amplitude, frequency, phase) of a high frequency carrier wave is made to change in accordance with a given low frequency message signal.<br />
(ii) (a) Modulated wave 1 : Frequency Modulation (FM)<br />
(b) Modulated wave 2 : Amplitude Modulation (AM)</p>
<p>Two advantages of FM over AM :</p>
<ol>
<li>Lower noise, better power efficiency.</li>
<li>Higher operating range.</li>
<li>Higher fidelity reception.</li>
</ol>
<p>Two advantages of AM over FM :</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple circuits are required.</li>
<li>Lower frequency space for transmission.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 101.<br />
Give (brief) reasons for the following :<br />
(a) We use the &#8216;sky wave&#8217; mode of propagation, of electromagnetic waves, only for frequencies up to 30 to 40 MHz.<br />
(b) The LOS communication, via space waves, has a (fairly) limited range.<br />
(c) A mobile phone user gets an &#8216;uninterrupted link to talk&#8217; while walking. (Comptt. All India 2015)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) The ionosphere can act as a &#8216;reflector&#8217; only for e.m. waves of frequencies upto 30 to 40 MHz. Higher frequency e.m. waves penetrate into the atmosphere and escape.</p>
<p>(b) The range is (fairly) limited because the e.m. waves lose energy (fairly rapidly) when they glide over the surface of the earth.</p>
<p>(c) This is because of the presence of a network of base stations&#8217;/cells&#8217; which keep on passing the signals from one base station/cell to the other.</p>
<p>Question 102.<br />
Define the term &#8216;amplitude modulation&#8217;.<br />
Explain any two factors which justify the need for modulating a low frequency base-band signal. (Delhi 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
&#8216;Amplitude modulation&#8217; is the process of superposition of information/message signal over a carrier wave in such a way that the amplitude of carrier wave is varied according to the information signal/message signal.<br />
Direct transmission, of the low frequency base band information signal, is not possible due to the following reasons :<br />
(i) Size of Antenna: For transmitting a signal, minimum height of antenna should be \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\). With the help of modulation, wavelength of signal decreases, hence height of antenna becomes manageable.</p>
<p>(ii) Effective power radiated by an antenna :<br />
Effective power radiated by an antenna varies inversely as λ<sup>2</sup>, hence effective power radiated into the space, by the antenna, increases.</p>
<p>(iii) To avoid mixing up of signals from different transmitters.</p>
<p>Question 103.<br />
(a) How is amplitude modulation achieved?<br />
(b) The frequencies of two side bands in an AM wave are 640 kHz and 660 kHz respectively. Find the frequencies of . carrier and modulating signal. What is the bandwidth required for amplitude modulation? (All India 2017)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Amplitude modulation is achieved by applying the message signal, and the carrier wave, to a non-linear (square law device) followed by a band pass filter as shown below in the block diagram:<br />
