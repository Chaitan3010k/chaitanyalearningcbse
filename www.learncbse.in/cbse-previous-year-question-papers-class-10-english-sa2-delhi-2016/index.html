<strong>Question.1 Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow:</strong><br />
<strong> One of the greatest advances in modem technology has been the invention of computers.</strong><br />
<strong> They are widely used in industries and in universities. Now there is hardly any sphere of</strong><br />
<strong> human life where computers have not been pressed into service of map. We are heading fast towards the day when a computer will be as much part of man&#8217;s daily life as a telephone or a calculator.</strong><br />
<strong> Computers are capable of doing extremely complicated work in all branches of learning. They can solve the most complex mathematical problems or put thousands of unrelated facts in order. These machines can be put to varied uses. For instance, they can provide information on the best way to prevent traffic jams. This whole process by which machines can be used to work for us has been called &#8216;automation&#8217;. In the future automation may enable human beings to enjoy more leisure than they do today. The coming of automation is bound to have important social consequences.</strong><br />
<strong> Some years ago an expert on automation, Sir Leon Bagrit, pointed out that it was a mistake to believe that these machines could &#8216;think&#8217;. There is no possibility that human beings will</strong><br />
<strong> be &#8220;controlled by machines&#8221;. Though computers are capable of learning from their mistakes and improving on their performance, they need detailed instructions from human beings to operate. They can never, as it were, lead independent lives or &#8220;rule the world&#8221; by making decisions of their own.</strong><br />
<strong> Sir Leon said that in future, computers would be developed which would be small enough</strong><br />
<strong> to carry in the pocket. Ordinary people would then be able to use them to obtain valuable information. Computers could be plugged into a national network and be used like radios. For instance, people going on holiday could be informed about weather conditions. Car drivers can be given alternative routes when there are traffic jams. It will also be possible to make tiny translating machines. This will enable,people who do not share a common language to talk to each other without any difficulty or to read foreign publications.</strong><br />
<strong> (a) What is the greatest advancement in modern technology?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) What complicated works are computers capable of doing?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Write one use of computers.</strong><br />
<strong> (d) Explain automation.</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why can&#8217;t computers lead independent lives or rule the world?</strong><br />
<strong> (f) How would computers as translating machines help people?</strong><br />
<strong> (g) What was the prediction of Sir Leon about computers in future?</strong><br />
<strong> (h) How can computers help people going on holiday?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) The greatest advancement of modem technology has been the invention of computers.<br />
(b) Computers are capable of solving the most complex mathematical problems and putting thousands of unrelated facts in order.<br />
(c) Computers provide information on the best way to prevent traffic jams, they can carry7 out complicated work in all branches of learning, they are used in industries, universities etc.<br />
(d) Automation refers to the process by which machines can be used to work for us.<br />
(e) Computers cannot lead independent lives or rule the world because they need detailed instructions from human beings to operate. They cannot make decisions of their own.<br />
(f) As translating machines, computers will enable people who do not share a common language to talk to each other without any difficulty and to read foreign publications.<br />
(g) Sir Leon&#8217;s prediction about computers was that computers &#8216;which would be small enough to carry in the pocket&#8217; would be developed and ordinary people would be able to use these pocket computers to obtain valuable information.

<p><strong>Question.2 Read the passage given below.</strong><br />
<strong> does a person become overconfident? The reason lies in over, assessment of his capabilities. Sometimes people over assess their competence and jump into situations that are beyond their control.</strong><br />
<strong> Napoleon Bonaparte who became Emperor of France would say that the word &#8216;impossible&#8217; was common only amongst fools. The overconfident Napoleon invaded Russia in the winter of 1812. This proved to be a big disaster.</strong><br />
<strong> Overconfidence generally leads people into misadventures, endangering their chances in life. It is wisely said that any achievement is a result of two factors—one&#8217;s personal planning and support from the external world. People, take into account only their planning, generally ignoring external factors. They become unable to foresee future developments. Hence, the great risk&#8217; of failure.</strong><br />
<strong> Then there is the question: how can one manage overconfidence? The formula is very simple. Before taking a decision discuss the matter with other informed people with an objective mind and when it is proved that you are about to go off the path, accept reality and say without delay, &#8220;I was wrong&#8221;. .</strong><br />
<strong> Overconfidence is a flaw characterizing people who lack the virtue of modesty. Modesty makes you a realist; you become a person who is cut down to size. People of this kind become very cautious; before taking an action they assess the whole situation. They adopt a realistic approach.</strong><br />
<strong> Overconfident people live within their own thoughts. They know themselves but they are unaware of others. Living inside their own cell they are unable to make use of the experiences of others. This kind of habit is highly damaging to all concerned.</strong><br />
<strong> There is a saying that the young man sees the rule and the old man sees the exception, with a slight change, I would like to say that the overconfident person sees the rule and the confident person sees the exception. Overconfident people are always at risk. It is said that taking risk is good but it must be well calculated otherwise it becomes very dangerous.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.1 Answer the following questions:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Why does a person become overconfident?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) What does overconfidence generally lead people into?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) How can one manage overconfidence?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) What kind of person does &#8216;modesty&#8217; make you?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) A person becomes overconfident because of over-assessment of his capabilities and competence and when he jumps into situations that are beyond his control.<br />
(b) Overconfidence generally leads people into misadventures endangering their chances in life and putting them at great risk of failure.<br />
(c) One can manage overconfidence by discussing the matter with other informed people with an objective mind and accepting reality when proved wrong.<br />
(d) Modesty makes you a realist; you become a person who is cut down to size. People of this kind become very cautious before taking any action.</p>

Delhi<br />

New Delhi<br />
Subject: Concern regarding large number of accidents in metropolitan cities Sir<br />
Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to express my concern over the large number of accidents taking place everyday.<br />
There are a number of reasons for this incessant rise in the number of accidents. The main reason being that most drivers are quite stressed while driving due to the adverse and erratic driving conditions. Poor road conditions make them impatient and they often lose their cool and drive recklessly and rashly. People also do not follow traffic rules nor do they adhere to speed limits thus leading to accidents. Mobile phones and loud music act as distractions. People are always in a hurry to reach their destination and as a result drive most recklessly. There is also an unfortunate increase in the number of drunken driving mishaps.<br />
To solve this problem the authorities need to take very stringent action and impose very heavy fines on traffic rule defaulters. Underage drivers and drunken drivers should be dealt with most severely and their licenses should be impounded immediately. I suggest that the number of traffic policemen and check-posts be increased to act as deterrents. It is also important that at the time of issuing driving licenses, a comprehensive class on traffic rules and regulations should be made mandatory.<br />
I hope you will publish my letter in your newspaper so as to bring the attention of the concerned authorities towards this problem and enable them to take strict measures to bring down the rising number of accidents.<br />
Yours sincerely Aruna<br />

It is imperative that children should follow and respect rules whether they are at home or at school. Following rules enables children to lead a disciplined and focussed life. Indiscipline and the temptation to break rules is growing among the children of today. Lack of supervision at home due to working parents and easy access to money is one primary reason for this. Moreover, excessive exposure to TV and social media and the constant need to Took and act cool&#8217; and to show-off has resulted in growing indiscipline and rebellion among children.<br />
It is very important to counsel children on the importance of rules and discipline. School rules are very important as they help to ensure that students know how to behave and the consequences of misbehaving. Children should be made to understand that rules are not about punishment but about setting certain limits and wanting them to behave within<br />
those limits. To make children respect rules we need to be clear about the behaviour expected from them and make them aware about their duties and responsibilities. Advance information and agreement about the consequences of not following the rules will act as a deterrent for a child to break the rules.<br />
Children should be made to realize that rules are made to be followed and there is no pleasure or gratification in breaking the rules.</p>
<p><strong>Question.4. Write a story in 150-200 words based on the input given below:</strong><br />
<strong> Uday&#8217;s dream—do something brave—win recognition far and wide—be famous in the</strong><br />
<strong> world—one fine day, he saw this opportunity when&#8230;&#8230;..</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> The parent-teacher meeting was scheduled for tomorrow—scared of informing them—had been scolded for missing school—no way out—cooked a story&#8230;&#8230;..</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
It was Uday&#8217;s dream to be famous in the world. He wanted to do an act of bravery and win recognition far and wide. One fine day, he saw four men who had recently shifted in the house opposite to his, acting rather suspiciously. At first he dismissed their suspicious behaviour to his over-imaginative mind, that was obsessed with the idea of becoming famous and was therefore always on the lookout for something sensational. But on that day he knew that the men were upto something. He saw them carry big cardboard boxes into their house, all the time looking apprehensive and being extra cautious. Uday could not ignore this. He decided that he would intimate the police and personally went to the local police station. He gave the officer-on-duty all the necessary details. The officer spoke to his senior and he immediately ordered to raid the house. Uday was told to go home and within an hour the police raided the house from which six boxes of R.D.X—an explosive material—were recovered. Uday was so happy not only because he had become famous but mainly because he had been instrumental in stopping the terrorists from causing, widespread destruction.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
&#8230;..The parent-teacher meeting was scheduled for the next day and Rahul was scared of<br />
informing his parents about it. He had received a sound scolding from his teacher for missing school without permission and he was sure that his teacher would tell his parents about this. At first Rahul thought that there was no way out from this situation. He knew he had brought this upon himself, because of his own stupidity. But he also knew he had to do something to stop his parents from attending the parent-teaching meeting. Then Rahul cooked up a story. He told his friend to send him a message on his sister&#8217;s mobile saying that his class teacher would not be coming for the parent-teacher meeting the next day. He saved his friend&#8217;s number by the name of his teacher in his sister&#8217;s mobile. As soon as his friend messaged him, he showed the fake message to his mother who in turn informed Rahul&#8217;s father that they would meet the teacher some other day. Rahul heaved a sigh of relief for the time-being and promised himself that he would never do anything wrong that would annoy his parents. Even though he escaped a scolding this time, he never wanted to repeat such a mistake that would disappoint his parents and teachers.</p>

<p><strong>Question.9. Answer any four of the following in 30-40 words each:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) What were the blessings the albatross brought with it?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) How does Brutus interpret Calpurnia&#8217;s dream?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Why does Patol Babu&#8217;s wife tell him that he is counting his &#8216;chickens before they&#8217;re hatched&#8217;?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) What made the writer believe that he was good at writing ghost stories?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why did the narrator allow the snake to quench his thirst first?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) The sailors were stuck in the land of mist and snow and their ship was surrounded by<br />
icebergs, there was no sign of life. The arrival of the albatross was the first sign of life that gave them hope that they might survive. The fog lifted, the iceberg split and a &#8216;favourable south wind&#8217; began to blow. .<br />
(b) Brutus disputes Calpumia&#8217;s interpretation of her dream. He says it is a fair and fortunate vision. Caesar&#8217;s statue spouting blood in many pipes in which the Roman people were smiling and bathing signifies that Romans will gain fresh life from Caesar&#8217;s blood and great men will earnestly desire relics marked with his blood. Citizens will keep his hair and their handkerchiefs dipped in his blood as relics for their children and grandchildren.<br />
(c) Patol Babu&#8217;s wife makes this comment when she hears her husband bragging about his supposed glories and achievements. He feels the role offered to him will go on to make him famous and wealthy. His wife feels that he is being overconfident and overexcited and so she tells him not to count his chickens before they are hatched in an attempt to keep him grounded.<br />
(d) The writer says that he did not specialize in writing ghost stories but more or less they seemed to specialize in him. Whenever Jenkins called on the author to write a ghost story for his magazine he had always been able to manage to write one for him, not really understanding how the idea of the plot came to him.<br />
(e) A snake visited the poet&#8217;s water trough on a hot afternoon to quench his thirst. The poet had also gone there to fill water in a pitcher. He waited for the snake and allowed him to quench his thirst first as he had come to the trough before the poet. He acts as a good host and treats the snake as an honourable guest.</p>
<p><strong>Question.10. Answer the following in 80-100 words:</strong><br />
<strong> How does Helen&#8217;s appearance in the party make Lavinia get rid of her superstitious belief in Ouija Boards?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Bring out the irony in the words, &#8220;My name is Ozymandias, king of kings, Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!&#8221; as inscribed on the pedestal of the statue. What lesson does this irony teach us?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
When in the party the Ouija board refers to John as a traitor and hints at the name of someone by the name of Helen in his life, Lavinia is not amused. She looks at John very suspectingly, through narrow lids and then as all the other ladies get after John, Lavinia becomes all the more angry. Next morning, she tells John that she is leaving the house and her lawyers would communicate with him later. When asked by her maid, Gladolia, as to what should be done with the Ouija board, Lavinia tells her to use the board for kindling wood. When Lavinia finally gets to know Helen&#8217;s real identity that Helen is actually a ghost, she is finally able to get rid of her superstitious belief in Ouija boards. She is finally able to forgive John as he could not be having an affair with a spirit.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Ozymandias is an arrogant king who is very proud of his power and glory, so he refers to himself as &#8216;king of kings&#8217;. When he addresses the &#8216;ye Mighty&#8217;—the other contemporary kings who consider themselves powerful—he tells them to despair as their achievements and accomplishments can never match or even come close to his own. Ozymandias gets his statue made to immortalize his glory. But the irony is that with the passage of time his statue is destroyed and becomes a colossal wreck. His statue which was made to create awe and wonder for the powerful king lies in a dilapidated condition, with no trace of his glory. Only the legs of the statue stand erect, the upper portion has fallen and is almost buried in the desert. Everything expect Ozymandias&#8217; cruel face was destroyed. So the message conveyed through this poem is that the glories of our blood and state are mere shadows and not everlasting. Even the authority of a king must end.</p>
<p><strong>Question.11. Answer the following in 150-200 words:</strong><br />
<strong> Helen&#8217;s contact with Dr. Bell raised her perception and understanding of the world. Comment.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Helen&#8217;s teacher took her across the tough road of her life. What role did she play in her success?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Anne Frank&#8217;s growing years were not normal. Elaborate.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> The Annexe was almost a prison for Anne. How did it limit her life?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
When Helen remembered the first time she met Dr. Bell as a child, she wrote that she felt he understood her and she &#8216;loved him at once&#8217;. Dr. Bell referred Helen to the Perkins Institution in Boston and Anne Sullivan was sent to Helen&#8217;s home to begin her education. Helen was extremely grateful to Dr. Bell for broadening her horizons. In the following year, the two frequently spent time together, developing something of a parent-child relationship along the way. In 1888, when Helen went to visit Dr. Bell she met with President Grover Cleveland. In 1893, Helen accompanied Dr. Bell to the World&#8217;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where he acted as Helen&#8217;s personal guide and taught her about modern science and technology. When Helen expressed a desire to attend regular college, Dr. Bell established a trust fund for Helen. When Helen began attending Radcliffe College in Boston, it was with this trust fund, as well as further financial support from Dr. Bell that paid for her education. Through Dr. Bell&#8217;s constant support Helen was exposed to a new world, new sensations, discoveries and her perception and understanding of the world was enhanced.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Helen&#8217;s teacher, Miss Anne Sullivan, was instrumental in taking her across the tough road of her life. She played a very important role in Helen&#8217;s success. She taught her words, related to sense, smell and language and helped her to read and communicate.<br />
Also, See Q. 11 (2nd option), 2012 (I Outside Delhi).<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Anne Frank&#8217;s growing years were not normal because she belonged to a Jew family who were in hiding during the Nazi reign of terror. Her family was subjected to various rules for Jews, like Jewish children could attend only Jewish schools, they faced curfews, were forced to wear a yellow star etc. In July 1942, they were forced to go into hiding, in the Annexe. In her diary, Anne gives an incredibly candid and eloquent account of her life in confinement. It expresses her fear, boredom and confusion at the situation she found herself in. Living in such extreme circumstances, Anne struggled with the universal problem of growing up. Anne feels very lonely and longs for kindness and affection, which she feels her mother is incapable of giving her. Anne refers to herself as a &#8216;bundle of contradictions&#8217; a few days before her family is deported to the concentration camps. These contradictions highlight the difference between the young girl that she actually is and the adult this horrible situation forces her to become, thus making her growing years not normal.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Anne Frank, like the others, finds it difficult hiding in the Annexe. It restricted their contact with the outside world and they always had to be very careful. Life was very tense as they lived in constant fear of being discovered. Moreover, it was certainly not easy for eight people to live in such cold quarters, sharing the darkness and dampness of the Annexe. Food was also rationed and they were deprived of basic facilities. These unusual circumstances combined with the normal occurrences of life, like Anne&#8217;s adolescent frustrations with h&amp;r mother and her developing sexuality, limited her life to a great extent. The fact that they had to stay indoors and be extremely quiet during the day made the Annexe worse than a prison for Anne. There was also a lot of tension, probably due to the oppressive nature of the hiding place and the occupants often quarreled among themselves. As Anne&#8217;s father rightly noted about her, &#8220;It was clear from the beginning that life in hiding would be far more difficult for the spirited Anne than for us. We were aware of how much she would miss her many friends in school.&#8221; Anne herself writes,&#8221; the nicest part is being able to write down all my thoughts and feelings, otherwise I&#8217;d absolutely suffocate&#8221;.</p>

<strong> Question.4. Write a story in 150-200 words based on the input given below: 10</strong><br />
<strong> She finally had it—the key to the treasure—the map—she trembled—excitement— anticipation</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Truth always pays—spoke truth—got in trouble—upset—changed mind—later realised — better in the long run</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
She finally had it. The key to the treasure. Rani&#8217;s hands trembled with excitement and anticipation as she held the map which she had been searching for ever since her grandmother had passed away six months ago. The old lady had confided in her that a treasure lay in the house in their native place. There was a map providing the details as to the whereabouts of the treasure which was hidden somewhere in the backyard by her grandfather who had never told her exactly where he had buried it. Now she found the map, which was in quite a decent state, because it had been kept in a plastic box that was buried in the backyard. Rani decided she would leave for her native place, which was a six hour drive, the next morning. As she lay in bed, excited, sleep eluded her. Her mind drifted to what the contents of the treasure were and if it would be of value. She contemplated if she should tell her family but then decided against it. She would tell them only after she had found the treasure. If the treasure was indeed valuable, she would ensure it was fairly distributed among all the family members. She waited for the sun to rise so that she could start her journey for a day which could be most eventful.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Ram had heard and believed the saying, &#8216;Truth always pays&#8217;. But now he began to actually consider its authenticity because he had got into trouble whenever he had spoken the truth. He was really upset and decided that from now on he would not always speak the truth. It was probably better to lie and save one&#8217;s self from undue hassles and problems one mostly faced when he was truthful. So that day when he wanted to go for a movie with his friends he lied to his parents telling them that he was going to his friend&#8217;s place to study. But as his mother interrogated him about the name, the time and the place where he was going to watch the movie, Ram could actually feel the genuineness and concern in her voice and he did not want to lie to her. He also realised that one lie was leading to the other and when she would come to know that he had lied to her and broken her trust, she would be very upset and heartbroken. He realised that in this way he would never be able to earn her trust again in future. So he made up his mind that in long run it is always better to speak the truth and that truth always pays. It enables one to win the trust of others.</p>

(a) See Q. 9(d), 2011 (I Delhi).<br />
(b) The superstitions which scare Calpurnia are the whelping of a lioness in the streets, the opening up of graves and yielding up their dead, fierce fiery warriors fighting upon the clouds in their proper ranks and correct battle order drizzling blood upon the city, the groaning of dying men and ghosts shrieking in the streets.<br />
(c) Gogon Pakrashi, Patol Babu&#8217;s mentor, taught him that however small a part one was offered he should never consider it beneath his dignity to accept it. No role is big or small for an artist. As an artist one&#8217;s aim should be to make the most of this opportunity and squeeze the last drop of meaning out of his lines.<br />

The need for teaching art and music in schools is important as it ensures better emotional development of students and also enables in shaping their personalities. Studies show that music has the power to relax the mind and is a wonderful method of relieving stress. Nobody can argue that art and music can help students relax after their long hours of studying hard. There are many scientific researches showing that music and art could reduce stress and improve human health. Students are still growing, and their bearance for stress is lower than adults. Therefore, they need music and art to minimize the risk of depression.<br />
Experts argue that the intrinsic pleasures and stimulation of the art and music do more than sweeten an individual&#8217;s life. The experience of making choices and decisions in the course of creating art and learning music carries over into other parts of life and enables students to experiment and try new ideas, thus giving their creativity a chance to bloom. When students are encouraged to express themselves creatively they develop a sense of innovation that will help them in their life.<br />
Another advantage of teaching art and music in secondary schools is that the talent of students in those subjects can be discovered when they are learning. The teachers are capable of assessing the students&#8217; abilities and can help the students to develop that aptitude.<br />
Art and music are thus a great way to encourage the process and the experience of thinking and enhancing one&#8217;s personality.<br />

Subject: Expressing concern over poor time management and lack of punctuality Sir<br />
Through the medium of the columns of your esteemed newspaper I wish to express my<br />
concern over a problem that some of us have often been ridiculed for and that is poor time management and lack of punctuality.<br />
Indians are generally known to be poor time keepers. We are often in the habit of procrastination, i.e., postponing tasks at hand. Being late is a cultural phenomenon and people take a lenient view on it in homes and in work places.<br />
It is imperative that we learn the importance of punctuality and time management or else it can have serious consequences on our self-esteem, professional reputation and even personal relations. Time management is viewed from the perspective of efficiency and developing time management skills comes with practice. Once we are able to manage our time we will automatically be punctual. The most important thing we need to understand is that time can actually not be managed. Time is finite and it is the work we need to manage as per the time. A person should be able to finish his task within deadlines, without last minute scrambling or compromising on work quality. In this way he will also be able to ensure punctuality. Effective time management includes ignoring distractions that prevent us from completing our tasks.<br />
By respecting time and staying focussed we will never miss our deadlines and compromise on the quality of our work.<br />
Yours sincerely<br />

<p><strong>Question.8. Read the extract given below and answer the questions that follow:</strong><br />
<strong> O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,</strong><br />
<strong> That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!</strong><br />
<strong> (a) By whom have the above lines been spoken?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Why is the speaker meek with the butchers?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) Write the antonym of the word, &#8216;gentle&#8217;.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> &#8220;This is only the first step on the ladder, my dear better-half! Yes</strong><br />
<strong> &#8230;&#8230;the first step that would&#8230;..God willing &#8230; mark the rise to fame</strong><br />
<strong> and fortune of your beloved husband!&#8221;</strong><br />
<strong> (a) What was &#8220;the first step on the ladder&#8221;?</strong><br />
<strong> (b) What characteristic does the speaker display here?</strong><br />
<strong> (c) What does the word, &#8216;fortune&#8217; mean?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) The above lines have been spoken by Mark Antony.<br />
(b) Antony fears that he may also be killed by the conspirators. He is meek with the butchers because he wants to win their trust for the moment and then avenge Caesar&#8217;s death.<br />
(c) The antonym of the word &#8216;gentle&#8217; is brutal/harsh/ cruel/rough.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
(a) &#8220;The first step on the ladder&#8221; was Patol Babu being offered a role to act in a Baren Mullick film.<br />
(b) Patol Babu boasts of his rise to becoming famous and wealthy. He displays ambition and confidence.<br />
(c) The word &#8216;fortune&#8217; means &#8216;wealth&#8217;.</p>
<p><strong>Question.9 Answer any four of the following in 30-40 words each:</strong><br />
<strong> (a) Give two examples of the use of supernatural in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner.</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Why did the poet throw the log at the snake?,</strong><br />
<strong> (c) What idea did Patol Babu have while rehearsing? What was the director&#8217;s reaction?</strong><br />
<strong> (d) Why did the spirit in the Ouija Boards call Hallock a traitor?</strong><br />
<strong> (e) Why did Calpurnia not want Caesar to go to the Senate?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
(a) At first the wedding guest addresses the ancient mariner as a loon and the next<br />
moment he is listening to him like a child. This clearly shows that the ancient mariner has a kind of magnetic power symbolised by his &#8216;glittering&#8217; eyes. Strange things happen when the sea is filled with colours that witches might have produced and the crew members dream about a supernatural spirit that is haunting their ship. The emergence of the Albatross from the mist, and the sailors revering it as a sign of good luck, as though it were a &#8220;Christian Soul&#8221; sent by God to save them is another supernatural instance.<br />
(b) See Q.9(b), 2014 (I Outside Delhi).<br />
(c) While rehearsing Patol Babu had thought that if he had a newspaper open in his hand and then the collision took place while he had his eyes on the newspaper, the scene would look more authentic and natural. The director, Baren Mullick agreed to his suggestion and requested a bystander to give Patol Babu the newspaper he was carrying for that one shot.<br />
(d) The spirit in the Ouija Boards called Hallock a&#8217; traitor because Helen, the ghost, had wanted him to exert his influence and get all his friends and acquaintances to stop using the Ouija Board and Hallock, on the other hand, had joined his wife and her friends in an Ouija Board party.<br />
(e) See Q.9(c), 2014 (I Delhi).</p>
<p><strong>Question.10 Answer the following in 80-100 words:</strong><br />
<strong> You are one of the crew. After the mariner kills the albatross, you have to suffer and there is no hope of survival. Write a diary entry of your feelings of regret and remorse.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Imagine you are Michael. Write a diary entry describing your spirit of fellow feeling with which you finally rescued Sebastian.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong><br />
11<sup>th</sup> June, 20xx ,<br />
Today, me and my fellow sailors have understood that we have to suffer incessantly because of the ancient mariner&#8217;s evil act of killing the innocent albatross and that there is no hope of our survival. The friendly bird&#8217;s arrival had enabled us to move away from the land of mist and snow where we were stuck without any sign of life. Then the bird travelled with us bringing us good luck all the while it was with us.<br />
I fail to understand as to why the ancient mariner shot the albatross which was an innocent and friendly bird. The albatross represented goodness and it was our saviour to guide us out of gloom and death. The conditions changed for the worst after our ship moved out of the land of mist and snow. The breeze dropped down and our ships was stuck in the silent sea with not a drop of water to quench our thirst. Now there is nothing we can do but feel a sense of remorse and regret at the ancient mariner&#8217;s thoughtless act. This heinous act cannot be undone and we will have to face its repercussions.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
18<sup>th</sup> April, 20xx<br />
It was actually a spirit of fellow feeling that first led me towards Sebastian&#8217;s help and his final rescue. When Sebastian appeared as the second sheriff in the first game some natural instinct and affinity made me follow him instinctively. Despite not knowing who he was I just followed him and did what he said. In each consecutive game that I played thereafter I kept receiving messages from Sebastian and my only aim was to rescue him. When Sebastian sent me an e-mail in which he thanked me for saving his life, we both knew that by reliving the accident something wonderful had happened between the two of us which can be described as a spirit of &#8216;fellow feeling&#8217;.</p>
