<strong>Question.1. Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
<strong>We sat in silence in the dark of the night as the large head appeared from the large foliage. The female ,was young, healthy and alert. Seconds later, she walked confidently to the edge of a waterhole followed by not one, not two, but three beautiful young cubs. Like works of art on display, all four tigers bent low at the waterhole that had been created for them and for the myriad creatures that shared their troubled kingdom. The Goshri tigers had come visiting and we watched them with rapt attention on our closed-circuit TV screens, in the conservation retreat of Harsh and Poonam Dhanwatey, a husband and wife team whose life had been dedicated to the protection of tigers in and around Maharashtra&#8217;s Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve. Their son Nikhii carefully positioned the cameras and cabled them 40 metres from their conservation retreat, near the waterhole that had turned into a magnet for every conceivable animal found in the Tiger Reserve itself. We were making preparations to set up one of the first Community Conservation Reserves in Central India. Originally into business, the Dhanwatevs changed tracks midstream by shutting down a thriving interior design business in response to just one meeting they had with Dr. Ullas Karanth and Valmik Thapar, two of India&#8217;s finest tiger people, in Nagpur. In their own words: &#8220;From admirers of wildlife we became passionate defenders and we launched our non-governmental organization called Tiger Research and Conservation Trust (TRACT).&#8221; The Dhanwatevs lived for years in a small hut that was their field camp near the famous Tadoba Lake and they discovered the secrets of the forest in the best way possible, by walking its trails, and generally learning all thev could about the magical mix of life that comprised this tropical, dry deciduous forest.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Question.2. Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
<strong>&#8220;Mum!&#8221; I shouted. &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221; I saw her little tent shuddering in the gale and listened closely for her response. Her voice was almost casual: &#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221; That&#8217;s my mother. It was the first night of our cycling trip through the interior of Iceland—a region so remote and inhospitable that for centuries, according to legend, it was abandoned. The weather was decidedly hurricane-like, but Mum wasn&#8217;t concerned. Months ago, I told her about my plan to pedal across Iceland. &#8220;It will be really difficult,&#8221; I said. &#8220;The roads are unpaved and often washed out, and the wind is blowing constantly — sometimes so hard that it pushes you off the road.&#8221; There was silence for a moment. Then she asked, &#8220;Can I come?&#8221; &#8220;Sure,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;But like the rest of us, you have to train to do two 160 kilometres a day back-to-back,&#8221; &#8220;Wow,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I could never do that.&#8221; I had more faith in my mother&#8217;s physical abilities than she did. I&#8217;d seen her raise six children and put in long hours doing physical labour on our small farm. &#8220;Sure you can,&#8221; I told her, &#8220;Start tomorrow.&#8221; What really concerned me was what 1 perceived to be her frustrating humility: I thought her too self-depreciating about her intellect just because she had not completed college. 1 felt she underestimated her attractiveness just because she was not the type to wear makeup or fancy clothes. As I had grown into adulthood, the life I&#8217;d chosen seemed light-years away from Mum&#8217;s quiet existence, still caring for her children and her children&#8217;s children. Sometimes, on a visit home, I&#8217;d describe some recent trip I&#8217;d taken, and her blue eyes would shine with interest. So I couldn&#8217;t help thinking this trek might revitalize Mum, who had started to slow down in her 50s. It might spice up what I saw as her humdrum life. And it might be a boost to her tentative and retiring persona. Mum trained furiously, months in advance. As the trip roster was pared down to Mum, my good friend Allen and me, she stood as the most dedicated. Soon she was riding 80-100 kilometres per day, and was as strong a rider as Allen or I.</strong></p>

<strong> Answer.</strong>Team Spirit<br />
By: XYZ<br />
Working in a team may be a challenge but it can produce great results if all members of the team work selflessly to achieve a common goal.<br />
Working in a team is actually a healer and a stress buster because the success or failure of a task, is a collective responsibility and not an individual problem. Each team member works towards a common target and gives varied views and ideas which can enhance productivity. Successful team work requires effective communication and a strong leadership, only then can conflicts be avoided and the focus is only on achievement of goals. In a team, negative attitudes should be discouraged and each member must have respect for the others&#8217; competencies. Good example should be set and unhealthy competition should be strictly avoided. There are always two sides of a coin but team work is a boon if some general rules regarding team spirit are adhered to.<br />
One must also try to put his best foot forward so that the concept of team spirit always remains beneficial and successful to each member of the team.<br />

Promoting Tourism<br />
By: William<br />
The present-day state of tourism in India is a cause of national concern. Though infrastructure and connectivity has relatively improved, much needs to be done about the boarding and lodging which does not cater to all levels of society. Another major area of concern for tourists coming to India is the dismal state of the security and safety. The Tourism Department of our country needs to take up concrete steps to improve the state of tourism in India. This should begin with maintaining and improving heritage sites, some of which are part of our historical legacy. Our tourism needs more aggressive marketing which should now be done using the power of the media. Last but not the least, each and every one of us should make a sincere effort to keep our city and country clean, as a beautiful and clean city beckons more tourism. By following these simple measures the tourism in our country is bound to witness a significant rise.</p>

<strong> The boys lifted trophy amidst cheers and jubilation from the spectators&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> Once upon a time there was a farmer who had a farm and lots of animals. He and his family, lived a happy and comfortable life. One day something unusual happened. The farmer went to the bam to collect the eggs the geese had laid. The farmer was taken by surprise when he found that one of his goose had laid a golden egg. He rushed to the town to sell the egg and got lots of money for it. The goose continued to lay a golden egg each day and the farmer and his family became richer and richer. He started neglecting his farm and other animals and soon it came to its ruin. But the farmer was not worried as long as he had the goose that laid the golden egg. One day the farmer and his wife were overcome by greed and thought to themselves that if they killed the goose, they would get all the golden eggs at once. They would become so rich overnight that they would never have to work again. They killed the goose and ripped open its belly but did not find any thing. It was like any other ordinary goose. By this,action, they even lost one golden egg daily. The farmer repented greatly over his folly and wept and cursed himself for letting his greed ruin him.<br />

It was a proud moment for the team of St. Joseph&#8217;s School as their boys had won the regional level football trophy after a long gap of ten years. I was a mere spectator in the stadium but the sense of jubilation and euphoria was contagious. I felt as though I was a part of the winning team. The feeling of pride and joy was evident not only on the faces of the players but also on the face of everyone associated with the school. Their football team had made them proud. The principal of St. Joseph&#8217;s School, who had accompanied the team, went to the field to personally congratulate the coach and each player. He announced that all the players would be felicitated by the school authorities in a special ceremony. An atmosphere of sheer nostalgia prevailed in the National Football Stadium. The merry-making continued as the winning trophy was taken to the school in the bus with loud cheers and excitement.</p>

<strong> (e) What makes Helen and the other ghosts organise &#8216;The Writer&#8217;s Inspiration Bureau&#8217;? What was their mode of working?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer</strong>. (a) The aim of the game &#8216;Drangonquest&#8217; appeared to be simple. Michael had to rescue the<br />
fair Princess Aurora who was imprisoned at the top of a tall tower from the wicked dragon, and collect the wicked creature&#8217;s treasure along the way.<br />
(b) Patol Babu was to play the part of a pedestrian in Baren Mullick&#8217;s film. He was to act as an absent-minded, short-tempered pedestrian with whom the hero Chanchal Kumar was Supposed to collide as he hurries out of his car and charges across the pavement.<br />
(c) The ancient mariner had killed the innocent albatross. To punish him for the crime he had committed, the other sailors hung the dead albatross around his neck. The burden of the sin in this way stayed with him forever and bearing his guilt in mind, he stops every stranger he meets to narrate his story.<br />
(d) The poet D.H. Lawrence considers himself a coward as he feels that he is not brave and daring enough to listen to the voices of his education and kill the snake. Rational instinct tells the poet that the golden-brown venomous snake should be killed but the poet does not have the courage to actually kill the snake.<br />
(e) In her other life Helen used to be a writer and the memory of not being able to the conjure up sufficient ideas weighed heavily upon her mind. So when she attained the form of a ghost, she made up her mind to help writers without ideas. She found others who had suffered similarly and between them they organised &#8216;The Writer&#8217;s Insrpiration Bureau&#8217;.

Subject: Importance of courage and bravery<br />
Dear Armaan<br />
Hope you are doing well and taking good care of, Mom and Dad.<br />
These days we are reading the play &#8216;Julius Caesar&#8217; which is a part of our academic curriculum. While reading the play I was really impressed by Caesar&#8217;s words &#8216;Cowards die many times before their deaths; the valiants never taste of death but once.’ I am writing this mail to you to tell you how important it is to be brave and courageous. It is a very vital character trait. Often, people do not do things that they would like to do, only because they are afraid or have self-doubts. It is very important to dream about what you really want and then go out boldly and just do it. Being brave takes away your fears permanently. We have to learn to stand up to our fears in their face so that they never bother us again.<br />
Lots more on this will follow soon. Till then take care<br />
Yours Lovingly,<br />
Arya<br />

When Patol Babu got an offer to act in a movie he is very excited. But later when he comes to know that his only dialogue in the movie is the monosyllable, &#8216;Oh!&#8217;, he is utterly disappointed. Nevertheless he quickly overcomes his initial disappointment and decides to turn this challenge into an acting opportunity and decides to give in his best to his miniscule role. He remembers his mentor&#8217;s words that no part, however big or small, is beneath the dignity of an actor. He began rehearsing the monosyllable &#8216;Oh&#8217; giving the exclamation a different inflection each time he uttered it. He further improvises his performance by being busy in reading a newspaper while walking on the pavement. Patol Babu, in this way, shows great strength of character. He does not get bogged by this challenge but gives it his best and performs the scene f lawlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Question.11A.What changes came in Anne&#8217;s personality because of her life in the Secret Annex? What impression does it leave on your mind?</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Give a character sketch of Edith Frank.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong>Her life in the Secret Annex sees Anne’s progession of individuation from childhood into adolescence, away from externally imposed restrictions and parental expectations. This process of self discovery and adolescent rebellion takes place within a timespan that allows very little space for Anne to test out her evolving self. Her body and self image change radically but others still treat and judge her as the child she once was. But it is not possible for Anne to retain her former childish self in the Annex because of the long hours of silence and the need for constant self-control. Tired of playing the family &#8220;clown and mischief maker&#8221;, Anne wants to take on a role different from the one others have come to expect of her.<br />
<strong>Or</strong><br />
Edith Frank was Anrte&#8217;s mother with whom Anne felt little closeness and sympathy. The two have a very tumultuous relationship. Anne thinks her mother is too sentimental and critical. But Edith Frank was good for Margot, Anne&#8217;s elder sister. Anne was not happy with the way her mother never took care of her and felt the latter had failed in being a loving and caring mother to her. Anne also mentions that her mother is frightfully irritable and always seemed to herald undue unpleasantness towards her and would stick up for Margot all the time. Her mother and Margot always backed each other up and finally. Anne became so indifferent that she resorted to utter indifference to her mother&#8217;s jawing.</p>
<p><strong>Question.11B. Helen had a special love for outdoor life. Explain by giving examples from the story of her life.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Give a character sketch of Kate Adams.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer.</strong> It is quite surprising that Helen had a special love for outdoor life. The sweet voices of the earth reached her through avenues other than hearing and sight. When Helen was in the woods, she loved to put her hand and catch the rustling of a small creature in the leaves. She enjoyed following dark roads that smelled of mo$s and wet grass, and hill roads and deep valley roads that were so narrow that the trees and bushes touched her as she passed. She often stood on little bridges and felt the stream flowing under it with her hands filled with tiny minnows (small fish). Many a times Helen would sit on a fallen tree for so long that many forest animals would step across her feet. The fragrance and vibrations of the forest relaxed Helen and she thoroughly enjoyed every minute that she spent outdoors.<br />
Or<br />
Helen was extremely close to her mother Kate Adams. During the first months after her illness, Helen only sat in her mother&#8217;s lap or clung to her dress as she went around doing her household duties. Kate Adams was extremely sensitive to Helen&#8217;s needs and was also of the firm opinion that Helen should be tutored. In the first five years of her life Helen developed a limited sign language which only Kate Adams understood. Kate Adams got some hope for Helen after reading about a blind and deaf girl Laura Bridgman. It was because of her and her husband&#8217;s determination and sincere efforts that Helen was able to overcome the strong barriers of her dark world.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong>EXPLOITATION OF ANIMALS<br />
By: Ramesh<br />
The Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been working for the well-being of animals for many years now. But it is most unfortunate that in spite of our active efforts people&#8217;s attitude towards animals has remained unchanged. They continue to take animals for granted and ill-treat them to suit their own selfish purpose. Almost 15% people believe that animals are man&#8217;s slaves. So, they continue to burden and torture them keeping this belief foremost in their minds. Another 35% people have an indifferent attitude towards animals. They simply do not care about animal welfare. They are blissfully unaware about even the existence of animals leave alone caring about their welfare. Around 50% people exploit animals for their own selfish interests. Animals are slaughtered mercilessly for their flesh, skin, tusks etc. It is high time we took a serious view of this torture to animals by making people aware of the injustice and cruelty upon animals. One way of achieving this is my making cruelty to animals a punishable offence. After all animals too are living beings and have as much a right as humans do to live peacefully on this earth.<br />

DEPLETING CONDITION OF PARKS<br />
By: ABC, Secretary Eco Club<br />
XYZ School<br />
Well maintained parks seem to be a thing of the past for the residents of Delhi. In the name of parks what is seen today is barren land, deplorable structures and garbage dumps.<br />
In spite of the government sanctioning lakhs of rupees the condition of parks in our city is depleting. Devoid of greenery, with plants dying, broken swings and rusted benches the parks present a pathetic sight. Even the government agencies are negligent towards maintenance of city parks. This is most unfortunate as these parks are supposed to be the lungs of the residents of Delhi. The Resident Welfare &#8216;Associations need to unite with the concerned agencies for the development and maintenance of the parks. School students should volunteer to plant saplings in parks. Corporate houses can also come forward to adopt the parks and work on their makeover and beautification. We need to take up individual as well as Elective efforts to develop our city parks.<br />
Green play areas at needed for children and it is the duty of the local government to ensure that the condition of the parks of our city is improved.</p>

<strong> Answer.</strong>Incessant Rise in Road Accidents<br />
By: ABC<br />
Growing prosperity has resulted in an ever increasing number of motor vehicles on the roads, with flow-on increases in traffic density, kilometers travelled and the number of hours people spend in their vehicles. Due to this, there has been an incessant rise in the overall road fatalities, and a ten-fold increase in deaths due to road accidents. Danger on roads is a man-made crisis with human error accounting for over ninety percent accidents. Road accidents are related to bad driving behaviour like driving recklessly and speeding under the influence of alcohol, changing lanes without signalling and jumping traffic signals. Road danger is not merely statistics, it causes a great deal of suffering for the people who lose their dear ones or who become handicapped for life. We cannot even imagine the extent of the disaster that takes place on our roads everyday and how big an impact it has on our lives.<br />

Subject: Need of the hour—Switch over to solar energy Sir<br />
Through the medium of this letter I wish to make a plea to the common people to switch over to solar energy to conserve electricity and limit electricity bills.<br />
If we decide to use solar energy as an alternative energy source it will be a great decision both for our budget as well as the environment. The Solar Power Systems have come up with excellent offers to promote a greener India. Solar cookers, lanterns, water heaters and heating and cooking systems are now available with v arious incentives. Let us not forget<br />
that the more electricity the solar energy systems generate during the day the lesser we need to buy from the electricity grid and this will certainly limit our electricity bills. As responsible citizens it is our duty to conserve electricity.<br />
I hope you will publish my letter in your esteemed newspaper so that my mass appeal reaches out to a vast majority of people.<br />
Your sincerely ,<br />
PQR</p>
