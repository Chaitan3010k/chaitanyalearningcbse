<p>Question 6.<br />
What are constitutional amendments?<br />
Answer:<br />
A constitution is not merely a statement of values and philosophy. A constitution is mainly about embodying these values into institutional arrangements. Indian Constitution is a very long and detailed document. Therefore, it needs to be amended quite regularly to keep it updated. Those who crafted the Indian Constitution felt that it must be in accordance with people’s aspirations and changes in society. They did not see it as a sacred, static and unalterable law. So, they made provisions to incorporate changes from time to time. These changes are called constitutional amendments.</p>

They agreed that everybody should become part of the solution, whatever they might have done or represented in the past.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
What was the reaction of the government towards the protest movement against the apartheid in South Africa?<br />
Answer:<br />
In South Africa, the white racist government continued to rule by detaining, torturing and killing thousands of black and coloured people.

<p>Question 9.<br />
Why did the South African people need a Constitution?<br />
Answer:<br />

<li>They wanted substantial social and economic rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 10.<br />
What was the philosophy behind the Constitution?<br />

<li>They guide all the articles of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution begins with a short statement of its basic values. This is called the Preamble to the constitution.</li>
<li>Taking inspiration from American model, most countries in the contemporary world have chosen to begin their constitutions with a preamble.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 11.<br />
What compromises did the blacks and white make?<br />
Answer:<br />
It was not an easy task for the two divergent people of South Africa—the White oppressors and the Black Oppressed one—to draw up a common Constitution for the country when it became free in 1994. After long negotiations both parties agreed to a compromises.</p>

</ul>
<p>Question 12.<br />

Answer:<br />
The Constituent Assembly was elected mainly by the members of the existing Provincial Legislatures. This ensured a fair geographical share of members from all the regions of the country. The Assembly was dominated by the Indian National Congress, the party that led India’s freedom struggle. But, the Congress itself included a variety of political groups and opinions. The Assembly had many members who did not agree with the Congress. In social terms too, the Assembly represented members from different language groups, castes, classes, religions and occupations.</p>

What did Ambedkar mean by ‘contradictions’ in his concluding speech to the Constituent Assembly? 4]Q8I<br />
Answer:<br />
Dr. Ambedkar, who played a key role in the making of the Constitution, but he had a different understanding of how inequalities could be removed. In his concluding speech to the Constituent Assembly, Dr. Ambedkar said that India was entering a life of ‘contradictions’ on 26th January, 1950. According to him in politics, Indians would have equality but in social and economic life, there would be inequality. The politics should be based on the principle of one man one vote and one vote one value. In social and economic life, by reason of social and economic structure one must continue to deny the principle of one man one value.</p>

<h3>Constitutional Design Class 9 Extra Questions Long Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Why was the making of the Indian Constitution not an easy affair?<br />
Answer:<br />
Like South Africa, India’s Constitution was also drawn up under very difficult circumstances.</p>
<ul>
<li>The making of the constitution for a huge and diverse country like India was not an easy affair. At that time the people of India were emerging from the status of subjects to that of citizens. The country was born through a partition on the basis of religious differences.</li>
<li>This was a traumatic experience for the people of India and Pakistan. Atleast ten lakh people were killed on both sides of the border in partition related violence.</li>
<li>The British had left it to the rulers of the princely states to decide whether they wanted to merge with India or with Pakistan or remain independent.</li>
<li>The merger of these princely states was a difficult and uncertain task. When the Constitution was being written, the future of the country did not look as secure as it does today.</li>
<li>The makers of the Constitution had anxieties about the present and the future of the country.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why should we accept the Constitution made by the Assembly more than fifty years ago?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Constitution does not reflect the views of its members alone. It expresses a broad consensus of its time. Many countries of the world have had to rewrite their Constitution afresh because the basic rules were not accepted to all major social groups or political parties.</p>
<p>Over the last half a century, several groups have questioned some provisions of the Constitution. But no large social group or political party has ever questioned the legitimacy of the Constitution itself. This is an unusual achievement for any constitution. The second reason for accepting the Constitution is that the Constituent Assembly represented the people of India. There was no universal adult franchise at that time. So, the Constituent Assembly could not have been chosen directly by all the people of India.</p>
<p>The way in which the Constituent Assembly worked gives sanctity to the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly worked in a systematic, open and consensual manner. First some basic principles were decided and agreed upon. Then a Drafting Committee chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar prepared a draft constitution for discussion. Several rounds of thorough discussion took place on the Draft Constitution, clause by clause. More than two thousand amendments were considered.</p>
<p>Every document presented, and every word spoken in the Constituent Assembly has been recorded and preserved. These are called ‘Constituent Assembly Debates’. These debates provide the rationale behind every provision of the Constitution. These are used to interpret the meaning of the Constitution.</p>
