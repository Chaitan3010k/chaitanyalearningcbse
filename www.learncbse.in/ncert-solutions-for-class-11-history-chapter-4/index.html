Answer:<br />
Main teachings of Islam:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idol-worship is a curse, according to Islam.</li>
<li>God, i.e. Allah is almighty. He is all wise and merciful.</li>
<li>Islam believes in life after death, in hell or in heaven. The sinner will go to the hell and face many hardships. The religious and honest people will go to the heaven. They will be served by beautiful damsels.</li>
<li>The Quran is the divine book of Islam. The sayings of Prophet Muhammad are regarded as God.</li>
<li>All are equal. No one is superior or inferior. Islam preached the principle of equality and brotherhood.</li>
<li>There is no restriction on keeping slaves in Islam, but Muhammad asked his followers to treat them kindly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Write your argument to justify the following statement:<br />
“Prophet Muhammad laid down the foundation of a new political structure.”<br />
Answer:<br />
Prophet Muhammad laid down the foundation of a new political structure as:</p>
<ul>
<li>He replaced the tribal organisation with a state. The state was encompassed with a number of tribes.</li>
<li>Umma constituted the armed forces.</li>
<li>He was a religious leader as well as a law-giver.</li>
<li>His followers (The Umma) were converted into a wide community to include polytheists and Jews of Madina.</li>
<li>The conquest of Mecca established him both as a religious as well as political leader.</li>
<li>He maintained the independence of the state by fixing the booty to l/15th (which directly went to him).</li>
<li>Tax like ‘Zakat’ was imposed on tribes who had accepted Muhammad&#8217;s leadership. All Muslim tribes had to pay it.</li>
<li>With his efforts and influence, he was able to convert many Bedouins into Islam. In a short span of time, he was able to unite a large part of peninsula.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 4.<br />
“Throughout the history of human beings their interest in religion often went hand in hand”. Justify the statement by giving examples.<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>From the very beginning, evidence has been traced out that Indian traders traveled to the different countries of South East Asia for trade in gold, tin, spices, etc. While travelling and trading to these nations they also took with them the ideas and practices of the religion. The ideology of Buddhism and Hinduism became the part and parcel of their culture. These two religions were adopted by the people of Jawa, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, etc.</li>
<li>The Arab traders in the medieval period established their trade relations with India and many other countries of Europe and Asia. They carried with them the ideas of newly founded religion, i.e. Islam. Due to its simplicity in principle, Islam was adopted by many Indians and in the same way it spread into Spain, Syria, Iran and Iraq.</li>
<li>The traders of the western countries, i.e. the traders of England, Holland, France, etc. spread their trading relations in many countries. They brought with them the ideas of Christianity. While trading, they also spread Christianity into different countries. Today this religion is adopted by the people of different countries of Asia and Africa.Keeping the above examples in mind, we can conclude that throughout the history human being’s interest in religion went hand in hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Discuss the main sources of income of the state in detail.<br />
Or<br />
What do you know about agriculture of the Central Islamic lands?<br />
Answer:<br />
Agricultural was the main occupation of the settled population, since long. It also remained a major occupation in newly acquired territories. The bulk of income of the state was derived from the agricultural land.</p>
<p>Land was owned by the small and big farmers and in some cases by the state. After Islamic conquests, big estates were abandoned and acquired by the state. Later on these states were handed over to Muslim elites. The chief among them were the members of Khalifa&#8217;s (Caliph&#8217;s) army.</p>
<p>The land conquered by the Arabs, which remained in the hands of the owners were subjected to a tax, called Kharaj, varied from 1/2 to 1/5th of the produce. While the land cultivated by the Muslims were levied 1/10th of tax, known as ushr as land<br />
revenue. When non-Muslims started converting to Islam, the land revenue income fell dramatically. To meet the shortfall, the Caliphs decided to discourage the conversions and later adopted a uniform land revenue policy.</p>
<p>After 10th century, the state authorised its officials to claim salaries from the agricultural territories called Iqtas (The person who held the Iqtas came to be known as Iqtadars). Agricultural prosperity and political stability went hand-in-hand. To ensure agricultural prosperity it took several measures such as canals were constructed, dams were built, the digging of wells, etc. were done. Tax concessions were granted to those people who brought land under cultivation. By the initiatives of peasants and state support the agriculture began to increase. Many new crops such as cotton, oranges, bananas, watermelon, spinach and brinjal began to grow and even exported to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Class 11 History Chapter 3 Passage Based Questions</strong><br />
Read the following passages and answer the questions that follow:</p>
<p>Passage 1.</p>
<p>Islamic Calendar:<br />
The Hijri era was established during the caliphate of Umar, with the first year falling in 622 CE. A date in the Hijri calendar is followed by the letters AH.</p>
<p>The Hijri year is a lunar year of 354 days, 12 months (Muharram to Dhul Hijja) of 29 or 30 days. Each day begins at sunset and each month with the sighting of the crescent moon. The Hijri year is about 11 days shorter than the solar year. Therefore, none of the Islamic religious festivals, including the Ramazan fast, Id and hajj, corresponds in any way to seasons. There is no easy way to match the dates in the Hijri calendar with the dates in the Gregorian calendar (established by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 CE). One can calculate the rough equivalents between the Islamic (H) and Gregorian Christian (C) years with the following formulae:<br />
(H × 32 / 33) + 622 = C<br />
(C &#8211; 622) x 33 / 32 = H</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
(i) When was Hijri era established?<br />
(ii) What do you know about Hijri year?<br />
(iii) What is the difference between Hijri year and the solar year?<br />
(iv) How can we calculate the rough equivalents between the Islamic (H) and Gregorian Christian (C) years?<br />
Answers:<br />
(i) The Hijri era was established during the caliphate of Umar in 622 CE.</p>
<p>(ii) The Hijri year is a lunar year of 354 days, 12 months of 29 or 30 days.</p>
<p>(iii) The Hijri year is about 11 days shorter than the solar year, which consists of 365 days.</p>
<p>(iv) It can be calculated by using following formulae:</p>
<ul>
<li>(H × 32 / 33) + 622 = C</li>
<li>(C &#8211; 622) x 33 / 32 = H</li>
</ul>
<p>Passage 2.</p>
<p>The Ideal Student:<br />
Abd al-Latif, a twelfth-century legal and medical scholar of Baghdad, talks to his ideal student:<br />
‘I commend you not to learn your sciences from books unaided, even though you may trust your ability to understand. Resort to teachers for each science you seek to acquire; and should your teacher be limited in his knowledge take all that he can offer, until you find another more accomplished than he. You must venerate and respect him. When you read a book, make every effort to learn it by heart and master its meaning. Imagine the book to have disappeared and that you can dispense with it, unaffected by its loss. One should read histories, study biographies and the experiences of nations. By doing this, it will be as though, in his short life space, he lived contemporaneously with peoples of the past, was on intimate terms with them, and knew the good and bad among them. You should model your conduct on that of the early Muslims. Therefore, read the biography of the Prophet and follow in his footsteps. You should frequently distrust your nature, rather than have a good opinion of it, submitting your thoughts to men of learning and their works, proceeding with caution and avoiding haste. He who has not endured the stress of study will not taste the joy of knowledge. When you have finished your study and reflection, occupy your tongue with the mention of God’s name, and sing His praises. Do not complain if the world turns its back on you. Know that learning leaves a trail and a scent proclaiming its possessor; a ray of light and brightness shining on him, pointing him out.<br />
&#8211; Ahmad ibn al Qasim ibn Abi Usaybia, Uyun al Anba.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
(i) What do you know about Abd-al-Latif?<br />
(ii) Why should books be learnt by heart?<br />
(iii) Discuss the importance of teacher in the life of an ideal student.<br />
Answers:<br />
(i) Abd-al-Latif was a legal and medical scholar of 12th century.</p>
<p>(ii) Books should be learnt by heart. If the books are lost, one should remain unaffected by this loss.</p>
<p>(iii) A teacher is like a torch-bearer. He plays a significant role in the life of an ideal student.</p>
