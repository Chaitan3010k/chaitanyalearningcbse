Fortunately, however, it never escalated into a ‘hot war*.<br />
(a) Explain the meaning of ‘hot war’.<br />
(b) Why was the ‘Cuban Missile Crisis’ considered as the high point of the Cold War?<br />
(c) “Ideological conflict was also a cause of the Cold War.” How far do you agree with the statement ? [1 + 2 + 2 = 5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Hot war was referred to direct attack by missile and bombs on other countries.</p>
<p>(b) Three weeks after the Soviet Union had placed the nuclear weapons in Cuba, the Americans became aware of it. The U.S. President, John F. Kennedy, and his advisers were reluctant to do anything that might lead to full-scale nuclear war between the two countries, but they were determined to get Khrushchov to remove the missiles and nuclear weapons from Cuba. Kennedy ordered American warships to intercept any Soviet ships heading to Cuba as a way of warning the USSR of his seriousness. A clash seemed imminent in what came to be known as the Cuban missile crisis. It did not break out in a hot war but is often considered as a high point in the cold war.</p>
<p>(c) It was indeed an ideological conflict between the two superpowers. USA represented capitalism and liberal democracy whereas USSR was committed to the ideology of socialism and communism. The cold war was not simply a matter of power rivalry and balance of power but was accompanied by a real ideological-conflict, a difference over the best and the most appropriate way of organising political, economic and social life all over the world.</p>

<p>Question 22.<br />
What is meant by ‘Shock Therapy’? Explain any four consequences of Shock Therapy. [2 + 4 = 6]<br />
OR<br />
Explain the idea of New International Economic Order (NIEO) for the development of Least Developed Countries (LDCs). Highlight any three reforms proposed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in 1972 to improve the global trading system. [3 + 3 = 6]<br />
Answer:<br />
The model of transition in Russia, Central Asia and East Europe that was influenced by the World Bank and the IMF came to be known as ‘Shock Therapy’. It was a painful process of transition from an authoritarian socialist system to a democratic capitalist system. The ‘Shock Therapy’ varied in intensity and speed amongst the former second world war countries, but its direction and features were quite similar.<br />
Consequences of Shock Therapy were :<br />
(i) Russia, the large state controlled industrial complex almost collapsed, as about 90 percent of its industries were put up for sale to private individuals and companies. This was called ‘the largest garage sale in history’, as valuable industries were undervalued and sold at throw away prices.</p>
<p>(ii) The value of ‘Rouble’ the Russian currency, declined dramatically due to high rate of inflation and real GDP of Russia also declined between 1989 to 1999.</p>
<p>(iii) The old system of social welfare was systematically destroyed. The withdrawal of government subsidies pushed to the periphery of society, and the academic and intellectual manpower was disintegrated or migrated.</p>
<p>(iv) Post-soviet states, especially Russia, were divided between rich and poor regions. Unlike the earlier system, there was now great economic inequality between people.</p>
<p>(v) The construction of democratic institutions was not given the same attention and priority as the demands of economic transformation. Dissent or opposition was not allowed.<br />
OR<br />
The idea behind the New International Economic Order (NIEO) was to ensure the sustainable economic development of the Least Developed Countries (LDC). The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) brought out a report in 1972 entitled “Towards a New Trade Policy for Development”.<br />
The report proposed a reform of the global trading system to :</p>
<ul>
<li>give the least developed countries (LDC) control over their natural resources exploited by the developed western countries. &#8220;</li>
<li>obtain access to western markets so that the LDCs could sell their products and therefore, made trade more beneficial for the poorer countries.</li>
<li>reduce the cost of import of technology from the Western countries.</li>
<li>provide the LDCs with a greater role in international economic institution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 23.<br />
Describe any three operations (military actions) launched by the US which proved and established its supremacy as a Hard Power. [2 × 3 = 6]<br />
OR<br />
Describe any three points of conflict between India and Pakistan. [2 × 3 = 6]<br />
Answer:<br />
The US power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its Military Power but even better than the absolute capabilities of the US is the fact that no other power in the world today can remotely match them. We can cite the three major military operations by US which indicate its supremacy as a Hard Power.<br />
(i) In August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, rapidly occupying every oil field. After a series of diplomatic attempts failed at convincing Iraq to quit its aggression, the UN mandated the liberation of Kuwait by force. This operation was known as “Operation Desert Storm”. The US President George H. W. Bush hailed the emergency and UN coalition, where 75 per cent forces were from US liberated Kuwait and Iraqi forces were quickly defeated. This is also known as first Gulf War. Thereafter, US invasion of Iraq showed the supremacy which finally ended in hanging of the President of Iraq, Saddam Hussain.</p>
<p>(ii) During the time of Bill Clinton, US was busy in other various issues but again in 1999, in response to Yugoslavian action against the predominantly Albanian population in the province of Kosovo, the US military action took place. The air forces of the NATO countries led by the US bombarded targets around Yugoslavia for well over two months, forcing the downfall of Yugoslavian government of in KOSOVO.</p>
<p>(iii) Another significant US military action during Clinton time was in response to the bombing of US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania in 1998. These bombing was attributed to Al-Qaeda, a terrorist organisation, within a few days of this bombing, President Clinton ordered “Operation Infinite Reach”, a series of cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda Terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. When terrorist, through 19 hijackers attacked Twin Tower in US on 11 September, 2001 (hence forth referred as 9/11), the response of US was swift and ferocious. US military attacked mainly Al-Qaeda and Taliban regime in Afghanistan.<br />
OR<br />
When Britishers ended their rule in undivided India and handed over the independence in August 1947, tmdivided India was divided in four states/countries, i. e., India, West Pakistan, East Pakistan and Kashmir. The conflict began immediately thereafter when Pakistan started claiming that Kashmir should be a part of Pakistan.<br />
The details of major three conflicts are as below :<br />
(i) Soon after the partition, the two countries got embroiled in a conflict over the fate of Kashmir. Pakistani government claimed that Kashmir belonged to them whereas, the Indian government claimed the same. Wars between India and Pakistan in 1947-48 and 1965 failed to settle the matter. The 1947-48 war resulted in the division of Kashmir province into Pakistan occupied Kashmir and Indian province of Jammu and Kashmir divided by the Line of control (LOC). Pakistan started supporting the militants and giving training to them, and started attacks in groups and killed many civilians.</p>
<p>(ii) Second issue of conflict was the control of the all Siachen glacier and over acquisition of arms. The arms race between two countries assumed a new character with both states, acquiring nuclear weapons and missiles to deliver such arms against each other.</p>
<p>(iii) India and Pakistan also have problems over the sharing of river waters. Until 1960, they were tocked in a fierce argument over the use of the rivers of Indus basin. However, in 1960, with the help of World Bank, India and Pakistan signed the Indus Water Treaty.</p>
<p>Question 24.<br />
Examine the six reforms proposed as criteria for new permanent and non-permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. [1 × 6 = 6]<br />
OR<br />
Analyse any three broad Components of the security strategy of India. [2 × 3 = 6]<br />
Answer:<br />
On the reforms of structures and processes, the biggest discussion has been on the functioning of security council. The following are just some of the criteria that have been proposed for new permanent and non-permanent members of the security council. For a new member, it has been suggested that it should be :</p>
<ul>
<li>A major economic power.</li>
<li>A major military power.</li>
<li>A substantial contributor to the UN budget.</li>
<li>A big nation in terms of its population.</li>
<li>A nation that respects democracy ajid Human Rights.</li>
<li>A country that would make the council more representative of the world’s diversity in terms of geography, economic systems and culture.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security council should reform and improve its working to make the UN more effective i.e., inclusion of member states should be judged on the basis of their contribution to peace keeping initiatives. Permanent members should be from industrialised developed countries and should have special Veto Powers. This position remains the same and no one is allowed to enter in this elite list. Such developed big countries usually neglect the need of smaller nations and such situation must be changed and balanced by enhancing representation from developing countries to become either permanent or non-permanent members of security council.<br />
OR<br />
India has faced traditional (military) and non- traditional threats to its security that have emerged from within as well as outside its borders, its security7 strategy has four broad components, which have been used in a varying combination from time to time. We will analyse these here components.<br />
(i) The first component was strengthening its military capabilities because India has been involved in conflicts with its neighbours—Pakistan in 1947-48,1965, 1971 and 1999; and China in 1962. Since, it is surrounded by nuclear armed countries in South Asian region, India’s decision to conduct nuclear tests in 1998 was justified in terms of safeguarding her national security. India first tested a nuclear device in 1974.</p>
<p>(ii) The second component of India’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interest. India’s first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, supported the cause of Asian. Solidarity, decolonisation, disarmament and the UN as the forum in which international conflicts could be settled. India also took initiatives to bring about a universal and non-discriminatory non-proliferation regime in which all countries would have the same rights and obligations with respect to weapons of mass destruction (nuclear, biological, chemical). It argued for an equitable New International Economic Order (NIEO). This strategy from India’s point was also justified.</p>
<p>(iii) The third component of Indian security strategy is centered towards meeting security challenges within the country. Several militant groups from areas such as Nagaland, Mizoram, Punjab and Kashmir among others have, fought from time to time, to break away from India. India has tried to preserve national unity by adopting a democratic political system, which allows different communities and groups of people to freely articulate their grievances and share political power. This strategy was absolutely correct.</p>
<p>Question 25.<br />
Describe any three major reasons that led to the declaration of Emergency in 1975. [2 × 3 = 6]<br />
OR<br />
Describe any four steps taken by Indira Gandhi to implement the ‘Garibi Hatao’ programme. [1 1/2 × 4 = 6]<br />
Answer:<br />
The emergency was proclaimed in response to a petition filed by Raj Narain, a socialist leader and a candidate, who had contested against Indira Gandhi in 1971, the following were the reasons given by the government for declaring a National Emergency in 1975.</p>
<ul>
<li>The government declared that there was a threat of internal disturbances and therefore, it invoked the article 352 of the constitution.</li>
<li>The government has a number of ideological differences with the judiciary. There were communication errors between the two regarding the appointment of Chief Justice of India.</li>
<li>Technically speaking, this was within the powers of government, as our constitution provides some special powers to the government once an emergency is declared.<br />
The President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmad thus proclaimed emergency, which became the most controversial episode in India’s politics.<br />
OR</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1971, Indira Gandhi gave a popular slogan “Garibi Hatao”. To implement the programme under this slogan, she took following decisions :</p>
<ul>
<li>Indira Gandhi focused on the growth of the public sector.</li>
<li>Imposition of ceiling on rural land holding and urban property.</li>
<li>Removal of disparaties in income and opportunity.</li>
<li>Government nationalised total 20 banks which controlled 70 per cent of India’s deposit and controlled distribution of money.</li>
<li>Indira Gandhi discontinued the princely privilages i.e., Privy Purse.<br />
Through Garibi Hatao programme Indira Gandhi tried to generate a support base among the disadvantaged, especially among the landless labourers, dalits and Adivasis, minorities, woman and unemployed youth. In the long run, this programme helped the people below poverty line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 26.<br />

<ul>
<li>Ozone layer depletion is an alarming concern for ecosystem.</li>
<li>Loss of fertility of agricultural land due to extreme use of fertilisers and overgrazed grasslands.</li>
<li>Coastal pollution too is increasing globally. Although the open sea is relatively clean, the coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted largely due to land-based activities. If unchecked, intensive human setdement of coastal zones across the globe will lead to further deterioration in the quality of marine environment.</li>
<li>Global warming causing melting of Glaciers.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR<br />
Demerits of Globalisation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive seeds purchased form MNC’s compelled farmers committing suicides due to crop failure.</li>
<li>Slowly and gradually MNC’s started buying Indian companies, resulted in instability in market.</li>
<li>While some advances were made in certain arenas, critical sectors such as health, housing and primary education did not receive the attention they deserved.</li>
<li>In view of increasing competition from the world, the economics tend to be over protective of domestic interests. This, ironically, leads the economics of the world to move away from one another instead of coming together.</li>
<li>Due to globalisation, the developed economics use the huge population and market potential of the developing economics to maximize their profits with little regard for social and other considerations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 27.<br />
“In the midst of severe competition and many conflicts, a consensus appears to have emerged among most political parties of India.” In the light of this statement, analyse any three elements of growing consensus. [2 x 3 = 6]<br />
OR<br />
“Jammu and Kashmir is one of the living examples of plural society and politics.” Justify the statement with any three suitable arguments.<br />
Answer:<br />
Growing consensus: On many crucial issues, a broad agreement has emerged among most parties. Though many of the political parties have ideological differences but such consensus help them come together and keep their rival political parties not to become ruling party.<br />
The main elements of such consensus are as follows :<br />
(i) Agreement on new economic policies: While many groups are opposed to the new economic policies, many among them are in support of the new economic policies. They believe that these policies would lead the country to prosperity and status of economic power in the world.</p>
<p>(ii) Acceptance of the political and social claims of the backward caste: Backward population in the country is 40.94%, the SC population is 19.59%, ST population is 8.63% of the total population. Hence, to attract these population, all political parties have recognised that the social and political claims need to be accepted. As a result, all political parties now support reservation of seats for the “Backward Classes” in education and employment. Political parties are also willing to ensure that the OBCs get adequate share of power.</p>
<p>(iii) Emphasis on pragmatic considerations rather than ideological positions and political alliances without ideological agreement: Coalition politics has shifted the focus of political parties from ideological differences to power sharing arrangements. Thus, most parties of NDA did not agree with the ‘HINDUTAVA’ ideology of the BJP. Yet, they came together to form a government and remained in power for a full term.<br />
It is clear from the above statement that to become a “RULING PARTY/ALLIANCES”, any party can shift from one camp to other camp. In present case, BJP alliances wanted to keep congress out of Central Ruling Party.<br />
OR<br />
Jammu and Kashmir: The political situation in the state has many dimensions :<br />
(i) Jammu and Kashmir comprises of three social and political regions: Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh.</p>
<ul>
<li>The heart of the Kashmir region is the Kashmir valley. The people are Kashmiri speaking and mostly muslim with a small Kashmiri which consists speaking Hindu Minority</li>
<li>Jammu region is a mix of foothills and plains of various languages speaking Hindus, Muslim and Sikhs.</li>
<li>The Ladakh region is mountainous and has very lithe population, which is equally divided between Buddhists and Muslims.</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii) Separatists want a separate Kashmiri Nation, independent of India and Pakistan. However, there is a group in Kashmir who wants greater autonomy for the people of state within the Indian Union. The idea of autonomy attracts the people of Jammu and Ladakh region in a different way-they ofteji complain of being backward and neglected. Therefore, the demand for Intra-state autonomy is as strong as the demand for the state autonomy.</p>
<p>(iii) The initial period of popular support to military has now given a way to the urge for peace. The centre has started negotiations with various sepatarist groups. Instead of demanding a separate nation, most of the sepatarists in dialogue are trying to renegotiate a relationship of the State with India. Jammu and Kashmir is one of the living examples of plural society and politics. Not only there are diversities of all kinds (religious, cultural, linguistic, ethnic, tribal) but there are also divergent political aspirations. However, despite all these diversities and divergence on the one hand and continued situation of conflict on the other, the plural and secular culture of the State has remained largely intact.</p>
