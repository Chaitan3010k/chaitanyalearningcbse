Here we have given CBSE Class 7 English Grammar Tenses.</p>
<h2>CBSE Class 7 English Grammar Tenses</h2>
<p>1. Read the following sentences carefully :</p>
<ol>
<li>Birds fly in the air.</li>
<li>My brother flew to England last week.</li>
<li>I shall fly a kite on Sunday.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the first sentence the Verb ‘fly* refers to the action in Present time, in the second sentence the Verb ‘flew’ refers to the action in the Past, while the Verb in the third sentence ‘shall fly’ refers to the action in Future.</p>
<p>2. The Tense of a Verb shows the time when an action takes place.<br />
There are three Tenses :<br />
I. Present Tense<br />
II. Past Tense<br />
III. Future Tense</p>
<p>3. In order to show at what stage an action is, each of the three tenses has been sub-divided into four heads. These sub-divisions are—</p>

<p>Thus, the tense of a verb does not show the time of an action or event alone. It shows the state of that action also.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I. The Present Tense</strong></p>
<p><strong>A. Simple Present Tense</strong><br />
The Simple Present is used to express :<br />
(i) A habitual action<br />
(ii) A general truth<br />
(iii) What is happening (in exclamatory sentences only)<br />
(iv) An order or request.</p>
<p>(i) A habitual action :<br />
I go for a walk daily.<br />
He comes to school at 8 O’clock.<br />
(ii) General truth :<br />
The sun rises in the east.<br />
Two and two make four.<br />
(iii) What is happening :<br />
Here comes the chief guest!<br />
(iv) An order or request:<br />
Obey your teachers.</p>

<p><strong>B. Present Continuous Tense</strong><br />
(Is/am/ are + Verb + ing)<br />

Examples : She is singing a song.</p>

IIs/am/are + Subject + (Verb + ing) &#8230;. ?)<br />
Examples : Are you going home ?</p>
<p>(iii) In Negative form, we add ‘not between the Principal Verb and the operative helping verb.<br />
[Subject + is/am/are + not + {Verb + ing) &#8230;]<br />
Examples y She is not weeping.</p>
<p><strong>Uses of the Present Continuous Tense</strong><br />
The Present Continuous Tense is used with the words—at this time, at present, at the moment, now, nowadays, still etc. and in the following cases :<br />
(a) To describe an action in progress and/or the continuity of the action.<br />
