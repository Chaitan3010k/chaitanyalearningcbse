<h2>Solved CBSE Sample Papers for Class 10 Communicative English Set 4</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">SAMPLE PAPER 4 (Solved)<br />
SECTION A : READING</p>
<p>Question 1:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow : [8] Spiders are not insects as many people believe. They belong to a class of animals called arachnids. Spiders have eight eyes, four pairs of segmented legs, and can grow a new leg if they lose one. They do not have antenna or wings. A spider’s body can be divided into two sections. The sections are the abdomen and the cephalothorax. The legs, eyes, and mouthparts are in the cephalothorax section. Most spiders have poison glands and fangs in their jaws, which they use to inject poison into insects. This venom can paralyse an insect allowing the spider to eat the insect as food. Spiders can live almost anywhere in the world. Some like very humid or hot temperatures and some like places that are very dry. Some spiders prefer to live under ground and others live in trees. We have all seen spiders that prefer to live in our houses.</p>
<p>These amazing animals usually have six finger-like silk glands called spinnerets located beneath their abdomen. The silk comes from inside the spider s body as a liquid that is thicker than water. A spider uses this silk to make a web by squeezing the silk out of two small holes at the back of its body. At the time the silk hits the air, the silk dries into a line that looks like a long string of hair. Spiders use this silk as draglines to hang onto as the wind blows it through the air. The spider can crawl up or down on this dragline if the wind takes it somewhere it doesn’t want to be. Young spiders and adult male spiders like ballooning and can release long silken threads that float or ride in the wind to new areas.<br />
There are about 30,000 different types of spiders known to scientists. Most of them are very tiny animals that help us by eating insects. The next time you are out in the yard and see a spider, take a few minutes to watch this most interesting animal.<br />
(a) What are spiders?<br />
(b) How many legs do they have?<br />

<p>Question 2:<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow :<br />
Understanding Pain<br />
Pleasure and pain are the inseparable facets of human existence. While the experience of our well-being is rather vague and intangible, experience of pain is real, and affects our body, mind and spirit, altering our lives in more ways than one. Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience caused by tissue damage that results from physical trauma, burns, illness, injury or surgery. Despite the agony caused by pain, it is essential for our survival. If you don’t feel pain, you could cause great harm to your body by inadvertently touching a hot iron or jamming your finger in the drawer and not even know it. Or you could rupture the appendix and be unaware of what was going on inside your body. Pain rings an alarm bell, alerting you to pay immediate attention and take quick action.<br />
Have you ever wondered why a severely wounded soldier continues to battle on so defiantly or an athlete injured during a race goes on to win it? It happens so because the brain does not react immediately to the pain signals, the sufferer just ignores them because there are more important tasks to attend. The pain registers only after the task or event is over. The perception of pain has been studied extensively by psychologists who suggest that there is a “gating system ” in the central nervous system that opens and closes to let pain pass through to the brain or block it. Psychological factors such as attention to pain, emotional state of a person, anticipation of pain and the way that a person interprets a situation can both open and close the “gates. ” This is why when you are depressed or anxious your pain seems worse and intolerable—because your feelings can open the pain gate. On the other hand, when your attention is diverted or focussed on pleasant tasks, your pain is<br />
almost imperceptible. Thus the physical cause of the pain may be the same, the pain circuits identical, yet the perception of pain is dramatically different.<br />
(a) Analyse the effect of pain and pleasure on human existence.<br />
(b) Explain, “Pain rings an alarm bell”.<br />
(c) Why does the writer give the examples of a wounded soldier or an injured athelete?<br />
(d) What does the writer want to convey by “open and close the gates”?<br />
(e) When is pain almost imperceptible?<br />
(f) Why is pain essential for our survival?<br />
(g) Which word in the passage means ‘looking forward to’?<br />
(h) What is the verb form of ‘survival’?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) It is difficult to describe pleasure, the feelings are hazy, not easily described. Pain, on the other hand, is real, an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience which does a great damage to our body and mind.<br />
‘Pain’ always gives a warning of something being wrong with us &#8211; without it we will never become aware of imminent danger to our well being.<br />
(b) A wounded soldier continues to fight his enemies just as an injured athelete continues to run, ignoring the pain as they have more important tasks to attend. The writer wants to convey that brain refuses to register the pain till they have completed the task, though it is there all the time.<br />
(d) The way one reacts to a situation, “opens and closes the gates”. If you are depressed or anxious, your feeling ‘open’ the gates for pain to rush in. If you do not give any attention to pain or anticipate it, you ‘close’ the gate to it.<br />
(e) If your attention is diverted, or focussed on pleasant tasks, then your pain is “almost imperceptible”, neither seen nor felt.<br />
(f) You can never become aware of danger, if you do not suffer from pain. A child will continue to touch a hot plate if it hadn’t learnt a lesson from touching it once.<br />
(g) Anticipation.<br />
(h) Survive.</p>

WRITING AND GRAMMAR</p>
<p>Question 3:<br />
The world today is very unsafe. At every step, we can face disaster of any kind—natural or man-made. Realising the importance of Disaster Management, write a letter to the Director, Central Board of Education inclusion of Disaster Management in school curriculum. You are Sanjay. (120¬150 words)<br />
• Define Disaster Management<br />
• How can it teach children?<br />
• What does it contain?<br />
• The help rendered by it<br />
Answer:<br />
2 Rani Jhansi Road<br />
Jhansi U.P.<br />
July 12, 20XX<br />
The Director<br />
Central Board of Education Delhi<br />
Sir,<br />
Subject: Inclusion of Disaster Management in the School Curriculum<br />
In today’s world, occurrences of natural disasters like tsunamis, cyclones, floods, earthquakes and droughts are unpredictable despite the working of warning systems in disaster-prone areas. A delayed warning spells disaster for life and property. The tsunami which ended up killing thousands in Asia, led to great devastation. Keeping such catastrophes in mind, the inclusion of a full- fledged subject like Disaster Management in the curriculum has become essential.</p>
<p>The CBSE has already introduced this subject in class IX and X but greater emphasis needs to be given to it and it should be introduced in other classes as well. Its main objective is to familiarise students with the fatal consequences of a natural tragedy. It will train their minds to lend their assistance and cooperation in organising rescue and relief operations and provide psychological support to the affected people. It would also train the students to work in tandem with Government agencies, NGOs and other voluntary organisations. They can boost the morale of the suffering people and reduce their trauma.<br />
Loss of man and material can be minimised through well-trained disaster managemeni programmes. So the students can prove to be responsibie citizens of society especially during such challenging mishappenings.<br />
I hope my views will find favour with the general public.<br />
Thank you.<br />
Yours faithfully,<br />
Sanjay</p>
<p>Question 4:<br />
Using the given clues write an interesting story in about 200-250 words.<br />
Dark night &#8211; quiet jungle &#8211; sounds of footsteps &#8211; followed footprints trail &#8211; reached lonely house &#8211; hidden behind trees &#8211; entered &#8211; shocked to see<br />
Answer:<br />
Abhinav Kumar was a well-known Shikari of the small town of Solan. He loved travelling through the forests near Solan, staying overnight in a cabin he had built there and hunting wild animals.</p>
<p>He had a shocking experience during one of his stays in the cabin. It was a dark night, the jungle was quiet and Abhinav was preparing to have a good night’s rest. Suddenly he heard distinct sounds of footsteps crossing his cabin. Who could it be? Abhinav picked up his powerful torch, slung his gun on his shoulders and crept out of his cabin. He could see footprints, they were certainly not of a man or woman but of a beast!<br />
lert now, he followed the trail, with his gun in his hand. After a long walk, which led to the less travelled part of the woods, he, to his amazement, found a lonely house hidden behind trees. He had not known of its existence. He entered the house and a shocking sight met his eyes. The empty house was a hyenas’ den, and they were tearing a woman’s body apart!<br />
Abhinav shot blindly, and in a rage killed all of them.</p>

<p>OR</p>
<p>What do we learn from the story ‘Mrs Packletide’s Tiger’?<br />
Answer:<br />
20 January, 20XX Dear diary,<br />
It is 2 o’clock (am, not pm!) and I’ve been running for almost an hour. I must pen down what I saw before I forget the details. I, a writer of ghost stories, was terrified by a ghost. Let me start with the time I left the editor’s house at 11 p.m. I had handed over to him my latest short story about two children, who saw a ghost every night. I decided to walk home, as it was a full moon night, my house only a mile away. After five minutes, I had an eerie feeling, somebody or something was following me. I looked around &#8211; no one in sight &#8211; the long lonely road, stretched behind and ahead of me. A loud sound of laughter made me turn and I turned to stone, struck dumb by the sight I saw two children, covered with blood, horrible, glowing eyes like embers, chanting horrible curses. As they tried to pounce on me, I came to life and ran. Fear gave me wings and I landed in my bedroom. Why did this happen to me? I feel there is a message in it for me. Why did I write ghost stories? Why did I write about children harmed by them? Why didn’t I write inspiring stories about good people, noble people, who helped to make the world a better place? I have decided to give up ghost stories and write about the finer values life to inspire</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>This story highlights the vanity of the two women who foolishly go to any limits to humiliate the other. They are governed by passions like jealousy and envy. They are far removed from normal human beings. They are always involved in parties, media attention and meaningless adventures just to out do and outshine others.</p>
<p>Most people have to earn their living doing hard work but Mrs Packletide hands knew only the art of holding playing cards. The aim of women like Loona Bimberton and Mrs Packletide was to enjoy humiliating and demeaning each other.<br />
This story teaches us not to copy the example of women like Mrs Packletide but to live a normal sensible life doing service to others rather than try to humiliate someone at the risk of your own reputation.</p>
<p>Question 11:<br />
Answer one of the following questions in about 200-250 words :<br />
Anne wrote, “Jan and Miep came in and were met with a delightful scene.” Describe the scene. Was it really delightful?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Which feelings do Peter and Anne share? How do they think they have changed?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Why did Helen find geometrical figures most difficult to understand? How did her difficulties disappear?</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Who was Mr. Anagnos? Why did Helen regret losing his friendship?</p>
<p>Answer:<br />
After the burglary incident the room into which Jan and Miep walked in was a perfect picture of chaos. Jan and Miep were greeted with shouts of joy and tears. The room was littered with a copy of Cinema and Theatre covered with jam and a remedy for diarrhoea, which lay opened at a page showing dancing girls, two jam pots, two loaves of bread, a mirror, a comb, matches, ash, cigarettes, tobacco, an ashtray, books, a pair of pants, a torch, a flash light, toilet paper, Mrs van Daan’s comb, etc. The room was worth a photograph. The inmates were in various stages of being untidy and they had no time to tidy themselves. They had half an hour to tidy themselves as well as the room. Anne and Margot took the bedclothes downstairs, went to the lavatory, did their teeth and comb their hair, tidied the room and cleared the table. The potties were overflowing, the stench was terrible. Mr Frank and Peter emptied and cleaned them with warm water and cholrine. They made some tea, boiled the milk and laid the table for lunch.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Peter and Anne are very good friends. They spend a lot of time together and talk about every imaginable subject. They don’t hold back even when discussing a delicate subject. They discussed subjects like trust, feelings and themselves. Peter comolimented Anne on alwavs beina cheerful: Anne was happy that he loved her as a friend. They have matured. Peter is no longer the shy quiet boy. He has opened up. Anne too has changed. She had become acutely conscious of her body, its functions and had frank talks with Peter about her parents, about differences between boys and girls, and about love. Her relationship with Peter has undergone a complete change. She says Peter loves her like a friend, his affection grows day-by-day but some mysterious force is holding him back. She writes that sometimes she thinks her terrible longing for him was over-exaggerated but that was not true. She says if she is unable to go to his room for a day or two, she longs for him desperately. She says Peter is kind and good and yet she can’t deny that she is disappointed in him. She says that she doesn’t like his dislike for religion, his table conversation and various things of that nature.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Helen could not follow with her eyes the geometrical figures drawn on the blackboard. She had to study mathematics without the essential tools. The classes were larger and it was not possible for the Cambridge teachers to give her special instructions. Anne Sullivan had to read all the books to her. Helen had to wait in order to buy a Braille writer so that she could do her algebra, geometry and physics. When the embossed books and the other apparatus arrived, Helen’s difficulties began to disappear and she began to study with confidence. However, Mr. Gilman thought that Helen was overworked and was breaking down. He insisted that Helen was overworked, and that she should remain at his school three years longer. He made changes in her studies. A difference of opinion between Mr. Gilman and Miss Sullivan resulted in Helen’s mother withdrawing Helen and Mildred from the Cambridge school. Helen went on to continue her studies under a tutor. Helen found it easier to study with a tutor than receive instructions in class.</p>
<p>When Helen took her exam in June 1899, she faced many difficulties, as the administrative board of Radcliffe did not realise how difficult they were making her examinations. They did not understand the peculiar difficulties Helen had to go through. However, Helen, with her grit and determination, overcame them all. ’</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Mr Anagnos was the director of the Perkins Institution for the blind. When Helen’s parents had visited Dr. Graham Bell to seek help for Helen’s education, Dr. Bell had advised Helen’s father to write to Mr. Anagnos. Mr Anagnos had contributed a lot for the cause of the deprived children and he had furthered the contribution made by Dr. Howe’s in this noble cause. Mr. Anagnos assured Helen’s father that he had arranged a competent teacher for Helen. So Miss Sullivan had come to teach Helen at the behest of Mr. Anagnos.</p>
<p>Helen had written a story called, “The Frost King” and words and images had come tripping from her finger ends. Everyone liked the story, so Helen sent the story to Mr. Anagnos, on his birthday. Mr. Anagnos was extremely delighted and the story was published in Perkins Institution reports. In a short time, it was discovered that a similar story called “Birdie and His Friends” written by Miss Canby had been published before. Both the stories were so much alike in thought and language so Helen was accused of plagiarism, which Helen couldn’t understand. Mr. Anagnos was deeply hurt and he believed that both Anne Sullivan and Helen had conspired to steal the story to impress him. Helen had to face the charges before a court of investigation, which shattered her emotionaiiy. Mr. Anagnos stated later that he had sided with the people who had been in Helen’s favour. He retracted his statement. Helen deeply regretted losing his friendship. She remembered how Mr. Anagnos had held Helen on his knee and shared in her frolics Nevertheless, Helen moved on and went on to become a great writer and social activist.</p>
