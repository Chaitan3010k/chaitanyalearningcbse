Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Environment Unfriendly Polybags<br />
By: Amarjeet, Staff Reporter<br />
The National Herald</p>
<p>In the year 2002 the government had banned the production and use of plastic bags in our country. But unfortunately, these are now being widely used again everywhere. Not only are we using a huge number of polybags daily but we are also discarding them in our drains uncaring about the fact that they will block the flow of drain water. Polybags are also a threat to our environment. They cause pollution, kill wildlife and are responsible for using up the natural resources of the earth. They are one of the main factors that litter the landscape. If burnt, they will infuse the surrounding air with toxic fumes.</p>
<p>The main problem of plastic bags is that they are non-biodegradable. The decomposition of plastic takes around a thousand years, so with the plastic rubbish produced each day it is likely that this problem will never be solved. While the government works out ways to lessen the impact of polybags on the environment each one of us too should shoulder some responsibility for this problem that ultimately harms us all.</p>

Tokonark Temple<br />
By: Anant, Leader,</p>
<p>History Society Kendriya Vidyalaya, Krishna Nagar The History Society of our school organised a visit for thirty-two students to the Konark Temple in Orissa. As the leader of the group I was entrusted with a big responsibility to ensure that our travel, stay and visit was smooth as well as informative. We reached Bhubaneshwar railway station and took a deluxe bus from there to the Konark Temple which is about 65 kms away. After checking-in to our guesthouse, we were served lunch and given pamphlets about the history of the Konark Temple.</p>
<p>We rested that night and went to see the temple the next day. On reaching there we understood why the Konark Temple is an architectural marvel of India. It is believed that it was built by King Narasimhadeva I of Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The temple complex is in the shape of a gigantic chariot, having elaborately carved stone wheels, pillars and walls. Konark houses a massive temple dedicated to the Sun God. There are three images of the Sun God at different sides of the temple, positioned in such a direction as to catch the sun&#8217;s rays in the morning, noon and evening.</p>
<p>Our three-day visit to the Konark Temple was most enlightening and an experience that enriched us about the amazing cultural heritage of India. We hope our History Society organises more such trips to other historical sites.</p>

Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Grandeur Of Republic Day Celebrations<br />
By: Ram, N.C.C cadet<br />
Shyamala Public School, Salem</p>
<p>Being an N.C.C cadet I got the privilege of attending the Republic Day Parade in Delhi. I was awestruck by its sheer grandeur and magnificence. The parade showcases not only India&#8217;s defence capability but also gives us a unique glimpse of our cultural and social heritage.</p>
<p>The Republic Day Parade which is held in the capital city, New Delhi starts from the Rashtrapati Bhavan, along Rajpath, past India Gate. Before its commencement, the Prime Minister lays a floral wreath at the&#8217; Amar Jawan Jyoti, a memorial to the soldiers who laid down their lives during various wars. The President then unfurls the National flag after which the different regiments of our armed forces march past with their bands in all their fineries saluting their commander-in-chief, the President of India.</p>
<p>Another highlight of the parade were the tableaus of different states that depicted India&#8217;s culture and diversity. Each Indian state and Union Territory is represented by a float that presents an aspect of its culture and is a visual treat. Watching the Republic Day celebrations was the most enjoyable experience and it was my good fortune to have got this opportunity to watch the parade from such close quarters, an experience that I will not be able to forget. The celebrations came to an end and everyone arose for the National Anthem following which the important dignitaries left Rajpath.</p>
