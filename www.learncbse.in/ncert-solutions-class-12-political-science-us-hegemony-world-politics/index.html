3. Hegemony as Soft Power: Mayank is a young and energetic man of Melbourne, immigrants from Russia. His father gets upset when he puts on black shirt with white jeans while he goes to church. He justifies that black colour signifies protest for freedom and white signifies freedom in a peaceful manner.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>5. Mention three ways in which US dominance since the Cold War is different from its position as a superpower during the Cold War.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â 1. During Cold War, the US found it difficult to win over the Soviet Union as hard power due to retaliating capacity of the Soviet Union and to protest world from large scale destruction. But in the areas of structural and soft power, the US dominated.<br />
2. During Cold War years, the Soviet Union provided an alternate model of socialist economy to maximise welfare of states. Still the world economy throughout the Cold War years adapted capitalist economy under the US.<br />
3. In the area of soft power, the US became triumphant. As the example of blue jeans shows that the US could engineer a generational gap even in Soviet Society on culture basis.</p>

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. what are the constraints on American hegemony today? Which one of these do you expect to get more important in the future?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer.</strong></span> âWe can identify three constraints on American Powerâ which were actually not in operation in the years following 9/11. Hence the US could establish its hegemony. Recently all these constraints are slowly beginning to operate in the following ways:<br />
1. The US bears institutional architecture in the American State itself. It refers division of powers between the three branches of government where American militaryâs executive branch can place significant brakes upon the unrestrained and immoderate exercise.<br />
2. The second constraint on American hegemony emerges from open nature of American society. American society and suffering from a deep skepticism towards purposes and methods of government in America despite an imposition of particular perspectives on domestic opinion in the US. This is a huge constraint on US military action overseas.<br />
3. The third constraint on US hegemony is the possession of NATO to moderate the exercise of the US hegemony today. The US has an enormous interest in keeping the alliance of democracies to follow the market economies alive and it may be possible to its allies in NATO to moderate the exercise of the US hegemony through their own liberal policies to fulfill their own ends.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>8. Read the three extracts in the chapter from Lok Sabha debate on the Indo-US deal. Develop any one of these into a full speech defending a certain position on Indo-US relations.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The following speech has been developed based on the excerpts from Lok Sabha debate as presented by Major General (Retired) B.C. Khanduri of BJP:<br />
Sir, I would respectfully draw the attention of august house towards the US hegemony in todayâs scenario. But we should not ignore the fact that India might be next waiting in the wings to perform as a superpower to maintain its own identity. Moreover, hegemony can not stand forever due to its weaknesses. Therefore, we are supposed to have a good and harmonious relations with that of the US for mutual promotion of trade and technology. But India should not compromise from the same on the cost of its own security and identity.<br />
Hence, India should work in a diplomatic manner while it thinks to go hand-inÂ¬hand the US in such a manner that India could extract best benefits from the US hegemony and find out mutual options for itself.<br />
Thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>9. âIf big and resourceful states cannot resist the US hegemony, it is unrealistic to expect much smaller and weaker non-state actors to offer any resistanceâ. Examine this proposition and give your opinion.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer.</strong></span> This proposition focuses only on, the powers of the state and believes that only big and resourceful states can challenge the US hegemony which it approaches right in a practical manner, but if we think deeply these are thoughts and pens of writers, expressions of artists, media and intellectuals who have no boundaries including hegemony itself to be criticised and resisted in the form of non-government organisations (NGOs), social movements and public opinion. Hence, non-state actors may challenge the US hegemony also in their own way and it can work out also.</p>

<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The US hegemony was the beginning of New World Order and process for its establishment had been started in August 1990 when Iraq invaded Kuwait and occupied it to make a part of Iraq. Despite UNâs diplomatic attempts to liberate Kuwait from Iraq, it was not liberated. Hence UN mandated liberation of Kuwait by force, a dramatic decision. A massive coalition force of 660,000 troops from 34 countries fought against Iraq and defeated it under UNâs âOperation Desert Stormâ. But it was led by the US because 75 per cent of the coalition forces were from the US only. This war is popularly known as the First Gulf War establishing the US hegemony.</p>

It was the most disastrous attack on the US. The hijackers attacked on important US building as World Trade Centre in New York, Pentagon building and Capital building of US Congress in Pennsylvania.<br />
The US responded to it by launching âOperation Enduring Freedomâ to arrest all those who were suspected to be behind this attack. The US forces made arrest all over the world without the knowledge of the government of the persons being arrested, transported and detained them in secret prisons mainly against Al-Qaeda and Taliban regime in Afghanistan.</p>

Its most appealing example is ofâblue jeansâ from the US, which had the capacity to engineer even as generational divide.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Short Answer Type Questions [4 Marks]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. How far is it correctly say that the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre was the attack on the US hegemony? Explain.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The US had established its hegemony through the launch of two operations namely âOperation Desert Stormâ where 75 per cent of the coalition forces were from the US and âOperation Infinite Reachâ, a series of Cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda. These operations made the US more confident of the establishment of the US hegemony that no one could dare to challenge the US. But, suddenly hijackers from Arab countries attacked on the World Trade Centre on 11 September 2001 alongwith the other important buildings also as Pentagon building (the US defence department) and the capital building of US the Congress. It was the most severe attack on the US soil since the founding of the country in 1776.<br />

<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>2. Describe any two constraints of American hegemony.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The US domination in military, economic, cultural aspects over other nations to show her supremacy is known as US hegemony.<br />
Its constraints are as follows-<br />
1. The institutional architecture of American State itself i.e. they follow the system of division of powers between three organs of government.<br />
2. The open nature of American Society and Political Culture i.e. the American mass media may promote a particular issue on domestic public opinion but never opposed the purposes and methods of government in American Political Culture.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>3. What military actions were taken by Clinton government despite their lack of interest were different from military power?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â The US President William Jefferson Bill Clinton believed in the policy of soft issues like democracy promotion, climate change and the world trade in place of military dominance. But the US revealed its military dominance even during the Clinton era wherever it was required by the US in the following manner:<br />
1. In 1999, the US responded.to Yugoslavian action against the predominant Albanian population in the province of Kosovo. The NATO air force countries under the US leadership bombarded targets around Yugoslavia for two months forcing the downfall of the government of Slobodan Milosevic and the stationary of NATO force in Kosovo.<br />
2. In 1998, the US launched an âOperation Infinite Reachâ a series of cruise missile strikes on Al-Qaeda terrorist targets in Sudan and Afghanistan in response to the bombings of US embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, Dar-es- Salaam and Tanzania.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4, Explain the hegemony of the United States of America as a structural power.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Hegemony as a structural power implies economic perspective of world economy. It can be summed up in the following ways:<br />
1. An open world economy requires a dominant power to support its creation and existence.<br />
2. The hegemon must possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and must sustain global structure i.e. Bretton Woods system set up by the US after Second World Wan<br />
3. The US reflects this hegemony by providing the global public goods, those can be consumed by one person without reducing the amount of goods available for someone else.<br />
4. A classical example of structural power of the US is the academic degree Masterâs in Business Administration (MBA) to sharpen business skills in a University.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>5. âEconomic preponderance of the US is inseparable from its structural powerâ. Discuss.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Economic preponderance of the US is inseparable from its structural power, it can be justified in the following manner:<br />
1. The hegemon shapes the basic global economy in a particular manner aS<br />
the US provided the Bretton Woods system after Second World War.<br />
2. We can regard the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as the products of American hegemony.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>6. In reference of structural power mention the global public goods by which the US established its hegemony?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â  The global public goods can be consumed by one person without reducing the amount of the goods available for someone else:<br />
1. Sea lanes of communications (SLoCs) is the naval power of the hegemon to underwrite the law of the sea and to ensure freedom of navigational international waters. These sea routes are commonly used by merchant ships.<br />
2. Internet is the direct outcome of a US military research project that began in 1950. Even today, internet relies on a global network of satellites.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>7. How does India maintain its relations with the US during post Cold War?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â After the collapse of Soviet Union India decided to liberalise its economy and integrate it with global economy. Indiaâs impressive economic growth rate made India an attractive economic partner for the US due to its technological dimensions and the role of Indian- American diaspora. These two factors are interrelated in the following ways:<br />
1. The US absorbs about 65 per cent of Indiaâs total exports in the software sector.<br />
2. 35 per cent of the technical staff of Boeing is estimated to be of Indian origin.<br />
3. 300,000 Indians work in Silicon Valley.<br />
4. 15 per cent of all high-tech start ups are by Indian-Americans.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>8. Explain the strategies which, may be performed by India to maintain Indo-US relations.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â In todayâs scenario India is supposed to decide what type of relations to have with the US. Moreover, the three strategies have been debated by Indian analysts:<br />
1. Indian analysts observed military nature of US hegemony and suggested that India should maintain its aloofness from Washington and focus upon increasing its own comprehensive national power.<br />
2. The analysts secondly suggest that India should take advantage of the US hegemony and the mutual convergences to establish the best possible options for itself in future perspective.<br />
3. The third strategy is suggested that India should lead in establishing a coalition from the developing countries to become powerful and work out in weaning the hegemon away from its dominating ways. Moreover, it cannot be concluded that India may opt for one strategy to maintain Indo-US relations, but it needs a mix of strategies to maintain its own identity.</p>

2. Read the following passage (NCERT Textbook, page 47) carefully and answer the questions:<br />
Some people argue that it is strategically more prudent to take advantage of the opportunities that hegemony creates. For instance, raising economic growth rates requires increased trade, technology transfers and investment, which are best acquired by working with rather than against the hegemon. Thus, it is suggested that instead of engaging in activities opposed to hegemonic power, it may be advisable to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system. This is called the bandwagon strategy.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Long Answer Type Questions [6 Marks]</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong>1. Examine any three factors responsible for the US hegemony in the world politics.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Three factors responsible for the US hegemony in the world politics are<br />
(i) The US power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power. American military dominance today is both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, the US today has military capabilities that can reach any point on the planet accurately, lethally and in real time, thereby crippling the adversary while its own forces are sheltered to the maximum extent possible from the dangers of war.<br />
(ii) No other power today can remotely match them. The US today spends<br />
more on its military capability than the next 12 powers combined. Further more, a large chunk of the Pentagonâs budget goes into military research and development, or, in other words, technology. Thus, the military dominance of the US is not just based on higher military spending, but on a qualitative gap, a technological chasm that no other power can at present conceivably span.<br />
(iii) The US invasion of Iraq shows that the American capacity to conquer is formidable. Similarly the US capability to deter and to punish is self-evident. More than forty countries joined in the US-led âcoalition of the willingâ after the UN refused to give its mandate to theinvasion. Thus, no country can deny the US superiority in the world politics.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>2. Explain the three types of US hegemony and give examples for each.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â GO Hegemony as Hard Power:<br />
(a) This hegemony signifies military status of America to be both absolute and relative. In absolute terms, it has military capabilities to reach any point on the Planet accurately and no other power today can remotely match them.<br />
(b) The US military dominance is based on both the higher military expenditure and on a qualitative gap i.e. technological know-how.<br />
(ii) Hegemony as Structural Power:<br />
(a) It signifies âEconomic Prospectsâ of hegemon power to possess both the ability and the desire to establish certain norms for order and sustain global structure even including goods to be consumed by one person without reducing the amount of goods available for someone else.<br />
(b) A classical example is academic<br />
degree MBA (Masters in Business Administration) to presume business as a profession to be dependent upon skills that can be taught in a University which is uniquely American.<br />
(iii) Hegemony as Soft Power:<br />
(a) US Hegemony has its cultural dimensions also which implies class ascendancy in social, political and particularly ideological spheres to shape the behaviour of competing and lesser powers.Here, the consent goes hand in and more effective than coercion.<br />
(b) For example, most of the dreams of individuals and societies across the globe, are dreams churned out by practices prevailing in twentiethâcentury America. All these are about the capacity to manufacture consent.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>3. What are different natures of hegemony? Explain.</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â Hegemony is an international system to dominate world by only one superpower. The natures of hegemony can be found out as follows:<br />
(i) Hegemony as Hard Power:<br />
(a) It is based on the military capability between the states.<br />
(b) The US military dominance is based on their higher expenditures on military as well as the technological know-how.<br />
(c) The US bears military dominance in both the terms i.e. absolute and relative. In absolute terms the US military capabilities can reach any point on the planet and no other power can be a match to them.<br />
(ii) Hegemony as Structural Power:<br />
(a) It is based on economic factors of the world dominated by the hegemonic power.<br />
(b) Hegemony must sustain global structure to establish certain norms for order and the US has set up Bretton Woods System.<br />
(c) The US hegemony has provided the global public goods to be consumed by one person without reducing the amount available for someone else as SLoCs and the Internet, MBA degree.<br />
(iii) Hegemony as Soft Power:<br />
(a) To dominate world even in reference of cultural dimensions i.e. class ascendancy in social, political and ideological spheres.<br />
(b) The US hegemony has the capacity to create âmanufacturing consentâ by the class to be dominated by the hegemon.<br />
(c) The âblue jeansâ from the US is capable to engineer even a generational divide.</p>
<p><span style="color: #993366;"><strong>4. How can the US hegemony be checked?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> Or</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #993366;"><strong> How long will hegemony last? How do we get beyond hegemony?</strong></span><br />
<span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Answer:</strong></span>Â (i) The US hegemony has been symbolised as the global village and other countries as its neighbours.<br />
(ii) If the headman of global village becomes intolerable, neighbours do not have any choice of leaving it, but develop a resistant.<br />
(iii) Though there are some rules and norms called laws of war that restrict but do not prohibit war.<br />
(iv) No single power can challenge the US militarily.<br />
Still, to overcome the US hegemony, the following strategies have been found out: (a) Bandwagon strategy emphasises not to oppose hegemonic power, instead take advantage of opportunities that hegemon creates i.e. increased trade and technology transfer and investments to extract benefits by operating within hegemonic system. (.b) To hide strategy implies to stay as far removed from the dominant power as possible as China, Russia and the European Union. This strategy is applicable to small states but states may not be able to hide for substantial length of time.<br />
(c) Non-state actors as writers, artists and intellectuals have no boundaries to work with. They can reach beyond the limits of the states to mould the minds of people through their expressions.</p>
