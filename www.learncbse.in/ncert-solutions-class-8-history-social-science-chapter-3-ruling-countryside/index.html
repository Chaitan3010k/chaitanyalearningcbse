<li>They demanded large tributes for the Company’s right to trade,</li>
<li>They denied the Company any right to mint coins,</li>
<li>They stopped the Company from extending its fortifications</li>
<li>Accusing the Company of deceit, they claimed that the Company was depriving the Bengal government of huge amounts of revenue and undermining the authority of the nawab.

</ol>
<p>Question 6.<br />
How did the assumption of Diwani benefit the East India Company?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Mughal emperor, in 1765, appointed the Company&#8217;s the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to exploit the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the company had earlier faced. Although its trade had expanded, it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. The overflow of gold from Britain stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenue from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues they used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Explain the system of ‘subsidiary alliance’.<br />
Answer:<br />
Under the system of ‘subsidiary alliance’, Indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces. They were to be protected by the Company, but had to pay for the ‘subsidiary forces’ that the Company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection. If the Indian rulers failed to make the payment, the part of their territory was taken away as penalty. The states which had to lose their territories on this ground were Awadh and Hyderabad.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
In what way was the administration of the Company different from that of Indian rulers?<br />
Answer:<br />
The administration of the Company was different from that of the Indian rulers in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Company divided its administrative units called Presidencies. There were three Presidencies &#8211;  Bengal, Madras and Bombay. In India, districts were the main administrative units.</li>
<li>Each presidency was ruled by a Governor. Districts were ruled by the Collectors.</li>
<li>The supreme head of the administration of the Company was the Governor-General. But in India, the head of the administration was the king. .</li>
<li>The main job of the Governor-General was to introduce administrative reforms while the main job of the Collector was to collect revenue and taxes- and maintain law and order in his district.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Describe the changes that occurred in the composition of the Company’s army.<br />
Answer:<br />
Several changes occurred in the composition of the Company’s army:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Company began recruitment for its own army, which came to be known as the sepoy army.</li>
<li>As the warfare technology changed from the 1820s, the cavalry recruitments of the Company’s army declined.</li>
<li>The soldiers of the Company’s army had to keep pace with changing military requirements and its infantry regiments now became more important.</li>
<li>In the early 19th century the Birtish began to develop a uniform military culture. Soldiers were increasingly subjected to European style training, drill and discipline that regulated Their life for more than before.</li>
</ol>

Mahadaji Shinde (1730-1794 A.D.) also spelled as Mahadji Scindia or Mahadaji Scindia, was a Maratha ruler of the state of Gwalior in central India.</p>
<p>Mahadaji was instrumental in resurrecting Maratha power in North India after the Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 and rose to become a trusted lieutenant of the Peshwa, leader of the Maratha Empire. During his reign, Gwalior became the leading state in the Maratha Empire and one of the foremost military powers in India.</p>
<p>He accompanied Shah Alarm II (Mughal Badshah) in 1771 to Delhi in order to restore the Mughals in Delhi. The Marathas were practically at that time ruling Delhi. He annihilated the power of Jats of Mathura and during 1772-73 and destroyed the power of Pashtun Rohillas in Rohilkhand and captured Najibabad. His role during the ‘First Anglo Maratha War was greatest from the Maratha side since he humbled the British in Central India, single-handed, which resulted in the Treaty of Salbai in 1782, where he mediated between the Peshwa and the British.</p>

Born Hyder Naik, he distinguished himself militarily, eventually drawing the attention of Mysore’s rulers. Rising to the post of Dalavayi (commander-in-chief) to Krishnaraja Wodeyar II, he came to dominate the titular monarch and the Mysore government. He became the de facto ruler of Mysore as Sarvadhikari (Chief Minister) by 1761. He offered strong anti-colonial resistance against the military advances of the British East&#8217;India Company during the First and Second Anglo Mysore Wars and he was the innovator of military use of the &#8216;iron-cased Mysorean rockets.</p>
<p>4. Maharaja Ranjit Singh<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-106962" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Social-Science-History-Chapter-3-Ruling-the-Countryside-Q11.3.png" alt="NCERT Solutions for Class 8 Social Science History Chapter 3 Ruling the Countryside Q11.3" width="213" height="414" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Social-Science-History-Chapter-3-Ruling-the-Countryside-Q11.3.png 213w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NCERT-Solutions-for-Class-8-Social-Science-History-Chapter-3-Ruling-the-Countryside-Q11.3-154x300.png 154w" sizes="(max-width: 213px) 100vw, 213px" /><br />

<h4>Class 8 History Chapter 2 From Trade to Territory Short Answer Type Questions</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Give an account of different European trading companies besides the British East India Company that entered the Eastern markets.<br />
Answer:<br />
Different European trading companies were:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Portuguese. By the time the first English ships sailed down the West coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India and had their base in Goa.</li>
<li>The Dutch. By the early 17th century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean.</li>
<li>The French. The French traders soon arrived on the scene for the same purpose.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 2.<br />
What were the grievances of the Company regarding the Nawabs of Bengal?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Company declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company. Trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages and rebuild its forts.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Write a note on Tipu Sultan &#8211; The ‘Tiger of Mysore’.<br />
Answer:<br />
Tipu Sultan was the famous ruler of Mysore. He ruled Mysore from 1782 to 1799. Under his leadership, Mysore became very powerful. It controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of these items through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also developed relationship with the French in India to modernise his army with their help. The British got furious. They waged four battles against Tipu Sultan. The last battle proved unfortunate for him. He was killed depending his capital Seringapatam. The way he resisted the British is undoubtedly praiseworthy.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Give a brief description of all the three Anglo-Maratha Wars. Also, write the main consequences.<br />
Answer:<br />
The Company waged a series of wars against the Marathas in order to crush Maratha power:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the first war there was no clear victor, hence it ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Sabai.</li>
<li>The second Anglo &#8211; Maratha War began in 1803 and ended in 1805. This war was fought on different fronts resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi.</li>
<li>The third Anglo &#8211; Maratha War of 1817-1819 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What administrative reformations were brought in the sphere of justice?<br />
Answer:<br />
Before the reformations were brought, there were Maulvis and Hindu pandits who interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti. The Brahman pandits usually gave different interpretations of local laws. But there was no uniformity in them. To bring out about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges, under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal &#8211; the Sadar Nizamal Adalat &#8211; was also set up at Calcutta.</p>
<h4>Class 8 History Chapter 2 From Trade to Territory Long Answer Type Questions</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Give an account of the Battle of Plassey.<br />
Answer:<br />
The Company was very keen to have a puppet ruler in place of Sirajuddaulah so that it might enjoy trade concessions and other privileges. It began to help one of Sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab. This infuriated Sirajuddaulah. He sternly asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with his soldiers to the English factory at Kasimbazar, captured the Company officials, disarmed all Englishmen and blocked English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company’s fort there. As soon as the Company officials in Madras heard the news of the fall of Calcutta, they sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. But no concrete solution came out. Finally, in 1759, Robert Clive led the Company’s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey.</p>
<p>In this battle, Sirajuddaulah got defeated. The main reason was that one of his commanders, Mir Jafar, did not fight the battle. He, in fact, supported the Company by not fighting because the Company had promised to make him Nawab after defeating Sirajuddaulah. The victory of the Company in the Battle of Plassey gave it immense confidence. It was the first major victory of the Company in India.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Who introduced the policy of ‘paramounty’? What did it mean? What sort of resistance did the Company face?<br />
Answer:<br />
Lord Hastings, who was the Governor-General of India from 1813 to 1823, introduced a new policy of ‘paramounty’. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom.<br />
However, this process did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex, the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1823 and died in prison in 1829. But this resistance movement did not stop. It was carried on by Rajana, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was also caught and hanged by the British in 1830.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
How did the East India Company begin trade in Bengal?<br />
Answer:<br />
The East India Company set up first English factory on the banks of the river Hugh in the year 1651. This became the base from which the Company’s traders, known at that time as ‘factors’, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored and it had offices where Company officials set. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory.</p>
<p>By 1696 the Company began to build a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata which later developed into a city, known as Calcutta. The Company also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty-free. The Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. For instance, Aurangzeb’s farman had granted only the Company the right to trade duty-free. But Company officials who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. But they refused to pay. This caused huge loss of revenue for Bengal.</p>
