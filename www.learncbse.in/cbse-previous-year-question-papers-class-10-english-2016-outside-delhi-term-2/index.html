<p>Question 1.<br />
Read the passage given below and answer the questions that follow: [1 Ã— 8 = 8]<br />
If you are addicted to coffee, and doctors warn you to quit the habit, don&#8217;t worry and just keep relishing the beverage, because it&#8217;s not that bad after all! In fact, according to a new study, the steaming cup of Java can beat fruits and vegetables as the primary source of antioxidants. Some studies state that coffee is the number one source of antioxidants in American diet and both caffeinated and decaf versions appear to provide similar antioxidant levels.</p>
<p>Antioxidants in general have been linked to a number of potential health benefits, including protection against heart diseases and cancer, but Sandra Vinson, a dietitian said that their benefits ultimately depend on how they are absorbed and utilized in the body. The research says that coffee outranks popular antioxidant sources like &#8211; tea, milk, chocolate and cranberries. Of all the foods and beverages studies, dates actually have the most antioxidants based solely on serving size, but since dates are not consumed anywhere near the level of coffee, the drink comes as the top source of antioxidants, Vinson said.</p>
<p>Besides keeping you alert and awake, coffee has been linked to an increasing number of potential health benefits, including protection against liver and colon cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Parkinson&#8217;s disease, according to some recently published studies.<br />
The researchers, however, advise that one should consume coffee in moderation, because it can make you jittery and cause stomach pains.<br />

(b) Caffeinated and decaf are the two versions of coffee drunk in America.<br />
(c) Antioxidants not only keep one alert andawake but also includes protection against heart disease and cancer.<br />
(d) Dietitian Vinson emphasizes that consumption of antioxidants ultimately depends on its absorption and utilization in the body.<br />
(e) Two important sources of antioxidants are milk and coffee.<br />
(f) Dates has a high level of antioxidants as compared to coffee. But despite this, it is still outranked by coffee because of the level of its consumption.<br />
(g) According to recent published studies, consumption of coffee has been linked to an increasing number of potential health benefits some of which are protection against colon and liver cancer, Parkinson&#8217;s disease and type 2 diabetes as well as coffee keeps one awake and alert.<br />
(h) Researches have warned that excessive consumption of coffee may cause jitteriness and stomach pains.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Read the following passage carefully: [12]<br />
Gandhiji As A Fund Raiser<br />
Gandhiji was an incurable and irresistible fund raiser. He found special relish in getting jewellery from women. Ranibala of Burdwan was ten years old. One day she was playing with Gandhiji. He explained to her that her bangles were too heavy for delicate little wrists. She removed the bangles and gave them away to Gandhiji.</p>
<p>He used to talk jokingly to small girls and created distaste for ornaments and created a desire in them to part with the jewellery for the sake of the<br />
poor. He motivated them do donate their jewellery for social usage.</p>
<p>Kasturbai didn&#8217;t appreciate this habit of Gandhiji Once she stated calmly, &#8216;You don&#8217;t wear jewels, it is easy for you to get around the boys. But what about our daughters-in- law. They would surely want them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well!&#8221; Gandhiji put in mildly, &#8220;our children are young and when they grow up they will not surely choose wives who are fond of wearing jewellery.&#8221; Kasturbai was very upset with the answer.</p>
<p>Gandhiji was determined to keep the jewels to raise community fund. He was of the opinion that a public worker should accept no costly gifts. He believed that he should not own anything costly, whether given or earned. Kasturbai was a female with a desire to adorn. But Gandhiji moved towards renunciation and donated every penny earned in South Africa to the trustees for the service of South African Indians.</p>
<p>Question 2.1.<br />
Answer the questions given below: [2 Ã— 4 = 8]<br />
(a) How did Gandhiji create a distaste for jewellery in Ranibala ?<br />
(b) What was Kasturbai&#8217;s apprehension about their daughters-in-law ?<br />
(c) What solution did Gandhiji suggest for the problem posed by Kasturbai ?<br />

Sub : Increasing thefts in our locality and inaction by the police.<br />
Dear Sir/Madam,<br />
I am writing this letter to express my deep concern over the increasing theft rate in our locality. The incidents of thefts are on the rise. There is an atmosphere of insecurity and fear in the entire locality. Approximately five cases of thefts have taken place during the last month. Along with thefts what really scares us is the injury and paranoia that is raised due to such incidents.<br />
To combat this fear, we, the residents of the locality have lodged a written complaint with &#8216; the local Police Station. In our complaint, we had requested for permanent patrolling by the cops during the evening hours. In spite of our repeated complaints, no action has been taken. This has only led to much fear and general distrust in the Police Force. I, on behalf of the residents of the locality, have decided to bring this matter to the attention of the concerned authorities through the medium of your esteemed newspaper.<br />
I am hopeful that you will help us in this regard by publishing this letter in your reputed daily.<br />

A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE<br />
Vishal was an eight-year-old boy who loved exploring. One sunny afternoon while Vishal was playing in the park behind his house, he saw a small bird sitting very still on a stone. He walked slowly towards it. Getting close to the bird, he realised that it was a sparrow but it did not fly away. It sat as if it were stunned. He was scared but decided to put his fears aside and take some steps.</p>
<p>Vishal carefully picked the bird up and ran home. He found an old shoebox. In this box, he put some old cloth pieces and placed the bird in the box. Using a dropper, Vishal gave the sparrow some water. He placed some rice grains in a bow and kept it inside the box. The little boy sat by the box the entire evening. In his worry, he swiftly fell asleep.</p>
<p>The next morning as Vishal was getting ready, he heard a soft chirping sound. On seeing the sparrow chirping, his mother told him that the sparrow was getting better. His mother promised him that she would look after the little sparrow while he was at school. Vishal went to school happily knowing that the sparrow would be safe.<br />

A HAND TO AID<br />
Indeed, it was a very hot summer afternoon! Summer vacations had just begun. For me, it meant endless days of cricket and eating dozens of ice-creams. One such summer afternoon, I was playing cricket with my neighbourhood friends. It was my turn to bat while my friend bowled. I could feel the sweat trickle down my forehead, as I hit the ball and it went straight over the fence. A direct six! But our eyes were not on the ball, instead it was on an old man who seemed to be walking in a daze.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he slumped to the ground. We left our cricket bats and ran towards him. A taxi driver sitting nearby came running too. He called some of the passers-by and with their help lifted the old man and put him in the taxi. They rushed him to the nearest hospital. The old man&#8217;s family was easy to trace as he had written their numbers on a piece of paper and kept it in his wallet. Later, that evening, we came to know that he was fine but had suffered a heat stroke. It was indeed a terrible summer day.</p>

It is morally incorrect to invade another country/planet for one&#8217;s own benefit. The Martians did not understand the value of peaceful coexistence. How did the book of nursery rhymes save the Earth from the Martian invasion ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Lomov and Chubukov were next door neighbours and Lomov had come with a marriage proposal for chobukovâ€™s daughter Natalya. Lomov on introducing himself to Natalya, spoke of his ownership of &#8216;Oxen Meadows&#8217; which led to the first quarrel between Lomov and Natalya who also claimed the ownership of the said land. Lomov explained to Natalya how the land was given to Natalya&#8217;s great grandfather&#8217;s peasants in return for making bricks and since it was in their custody for forty years, they considered it to be Natalya&#8217;s meadow. This argument continued till Natalya agreed to present the Meadows to Lomov who rejected the offer and the quarrel continued. This couple, unlike other, were very materialistic and they lacked the basic qualities like tolerance, or consideration that would make their marriage successful.<br />
OR<br />
Led by their leader, the Martians plan to launch an inter-planetary attack on the earthlings. The Martian space control probe the Centerville Public Library. They came across the book of nursery rhymes &#8216;Mother Goose&#8217;. They read the rhyme &#8216;Humpty Dumpty&#8217; and their misinterpretatin of this rhyme terrorized the Martian invaders. They terminated their plans of invasion and fleed. Aristotle once exclaimed that man is a social animal. He is regarded as one of the most concerned and loving human being. He has, from the very beginning learned to live, socialise and reason. Things Books have taught people how to live, when to commit, how to protect, etc, which could not be understood by the Martians.

IMPORTANCE OF GOOD HEALTH<br />
By Ram/Rama<br />
Health is a very important aspect in everyone&#8217;s life. Nothing is more important than health and fitness for any human being. Healthy and fit people enjoy their life happily and peacefully. An unhealthy person cannot enjoy life to the fullest. He/she cannot enjoy eating, watching sports, or other luxuries of the life. There is a famous saying &#8216;health is wealth&#8217;. In order to maintain good health, we need to take care of the hygiene and sanitation all around us. We should eat healthy and complete meals on timely basis. We need to remember at all times that a healthy child develops into a healthy adult.</p>
<p>We should eat green and fresh vegetables, milk, fresh fruits, eggs, etc. Our body needs sufficient amounts of proteins, minerals and vitamins on a daily basis to be fit and healthy. Along with healthy food and physical activities, we need to maintain cleanliness in our home and surrounding areas including our personal cleanliness. The maintenance of physical and mental health is very improtant for a person who wants to be successful. It is rightfully said by Buddha about health and fitness that, &#8220;To keep the body in good health is a duty, otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear&#8221;.</p>

SWEET IS THE FRUIT OF HARD WORK<br />
Ram had lost one leg to polio when he was a child. He possessed a brilliant mind and desperately wanted to attend a school. This brave boy refused to let the fact that he was crippled by polio leave him helpless. He decided to overcome his handicap so that he could study. He knew that despite the dire situations in the house, he had to make it to school.</p>
<p>His parents spent all the money they could on his treatments. In the end, both were forced to leave to work in the city, so they could send money back and continue treatment for their son. While other children used to play outside, he was confined to the house, unable to afford a wheelchair and could only see his mother and father a few times a year. His enormous determination to succeed and not to be confined by his limitations impressed many people in the village and attempts were made to find a place for him at a school.</p>
<p>Luckily one day, at one of the village meetings, an old gentleman stood up and stated his claim to help Ram realize his dream. This old man had gone through something similar in life and he was aware of Ram&#8217;s determination and desire to study. He had seen Ram sitting on the sidewalks and poring through his friends&#8217; book while trying to study. This old man seeing Ram&#8217;s determination, helped him enrol in a boarding school where he would be taken care of and would learn more. Ram&#8217;s hard work produced sweet results when he became the first engineer from his village in the countryside.<br />

<p>The entire time in class, her mind wandered to the party. She wondered if her parents would give her the permission to attend the party. She was wondering which outfit she would wear to the party. All these thoughts kept her from paying attention in class. As soon as Vaibhavi got home she ran and asked her mother for the permission to go to the party. Her mother agreed on two conditions, that her dad would pick her up by 9:30 and that her phone would be with her at all times, to which she promptly agreed. Vaibhavi enjoyed herself a lot at the party and checked in with her mother every hour. She messaged and told her mother that she was waiting for her father to pick her up. She was waiting for her father in the parking lot but she could not see him.</p>
<p>It was soon going to be ten, she checked her phone but alas! the battery died. She was worried, she decided to walk home as it was only a block away. Midway she heard someone call her name, she was terrified and hid behind a car, she saw a man walking towards her and that frightened her. When the person came close and stood beneath a streetlight, she ran and hugged him. It was her father! One of the car&#8217;s tyres was punctured and so her father decided to walk to her friends&#8217; house. Vaibhavi was both relaxed and happy that everything turned out well in the end.</p>

Sub : Increase in the number of road accidents in the city<br />
Respected Sir,<br />
I would like to draw the people&#8217;s attention towards the ever-increasing road accidents in the city. Your paper has itself reported twelve major accidents in the past two months in which several people have lost their lives. These accidents are caused due to several reasons. Some of these are poor road lighting, increasing encroachments, open violation of the traffic rules by drivers, absence of safety procedures and lack of traffic educations. The Deputy Commissioner of the city must chalk out a comprehensive plan to improve the traffic situation in the city.<br />
People could begin using public transport, which apart from reducing the strain on the traffic will be an efficient way of saving energy and the environment. Public transport will ensure that there are lesser vehicles on , the road and more place for the pedestrains to walk safely and comfortably. School children should be given proper traffic education. All vehicle drivers should be made to pass a screening test to judge their suitability as drivers. Roads should not only be repaired and widened but should also be provided with lamps to provide sufficient lighting. The use of helmets should be encouraged. Drunk driving should be stopped at any cost. People violating traffic rules should be punished. The traffic police should be encouraged to perform their duty honestly and efficiently. These along with many more steps need to be urgently taken to check this menace of increasing road accidents.<br />

HEALTH IS REAL WEALTH<br />
We all are aware and have heard that our parents have laid so much importance on the kind of food we eat. Whether our parents or theirs, the story of food has been same in every era. May be if we had some concrete evidence on how our ancestors dealt with this problem of eating right, then the story would have been just the same as today. We even know that if we eat right now then later, we will always be healthy. The food pyramid that we have seen and some of us may have been taught in school, also keeps carbohydrates and fats on the top of the pyramid. That is in the least quantity zone. Whereas, raw fruits and salads form the base. These are the things our mother nature provides us and in their natural form is how they should be consumed, without killing the vitamins and minerals they are loaded with. Even milk and meat come in the second tier.</p>
<p>Taking the food pyramid as our guide, where do puris, pizzas, burgers, sweets, cakes, iceÂ¬creams and chocolates fall? Not even on the top, as they are not a part of the food pyramid. That is why we put such food in an entirely different category. We call them JUNK FOOD! All such type of food that is laden with sugar, oil, butter and excessive salt damage our system on the whole. Though the effects may not be immediate, but they make our lives tough. This kind of food makes us lethargic, sluggish, and fat. We need to be aware of this. Why do you see so many advertisements backing upon you to come and eat, they gives schemes and offers, they allure you, entice you and tempt you to come and eat? This is all because they want you to eat food that is enticing to watch but unhealthy to eat. So the onus lies on us â€” shall we get entrapped or take our own decision to eat healthy and stay fit and strong. Choose wisely, after all it is one life that you have got. Eat to live or live to eat! The decision is yours.</p>

Answer:<br />
ALL THAT GLITTERS IS NOT GOLD<br />
It was indeed a sunny day! Sunita, a sixty-two- year-old woman, had just visited her daughter and was returning to her village. Her hands were full with the gifts her daughter had sent with her. While she was waiting for the bus to arrive, a youth in his 20&#8217;s offered to hold her bags for her to which she readily agreed. He told her that his name was Ramesh and was travelling back to his village which was a little further than hers. Sunita was delighted that she had some company. A little into the journey, Ramesh offered her some sweets, â€™ which she accepted. A few minutes later, she fell fast asleep. Ramesh swiftly took her gold bangles and the chain from her neck and got down at the very next stop.</p>
<p>After an hour, the conductor woke Sunita up as her stop had arrived. On waking up, she realised that all her gold ornaments were gone. She was scared and did not know what to do. The conductor immediately called the police and they registered a complaint. Sunita and the conductor also gave a description of the man who claimed to be Ramesh. The conductor also told the police that they had lately installed CCTV cameras at the bus depot, so there were chances that one of the CCTV cameras would have captured an image of Ramesh. The police thus began their search for the robber. Soon they found that Ramesh was trying to sell Sunita&#8217;s gold in a village not far from the stop. On nabbing him, they did manage to recover the gold and his identity. Sunita however learned a very improtant lesson that day that all that glitters isn&#8217;t gold and none can be trusted, blindly.<br />
OR<br />
A STITCH IN TIMES SAVES NINE<br />
Sunil was a seven-year-old boy, very often he was left at home alone as both his parents went to work. He lived in a posh locality. One day, while returning home from school, he found his front door open. At first he was scared and worried, but he gathered up his courage and peeped inside the house. He saw three suspicious looking men searching the house. A few days earlier, Sunil&#8217;s teacher had told them that if they ever find anything suspicious they should immediately approach an adult and dial 100 which is the helpline for the police. Sunil ran to his neighbour&#8217;s house and told them what he had seen.</p>
<p>Without wasting another minute, his neighbour called the police and within fifteen minutes, the police arrived and arrested the robbers. Sunil&#8217;s father told him that the robbers who were caught were notorious and wanted for several such robberies. Sunil recevied a reward for his bravery and was soon famous in his school.</p>
