What are the causes of Osteoporosis ? [3]<br />
OR<br />
Write briefly about the prevention and management of &#8220;Anorexia&#8221;.<br />
Answer:<br />
Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and brittle, so brittle that a fall or even mild stresses such as bending over or coughing can cause a fracture.</p>
<p>Causes of Osteoporosis are as follows :</p>
<ol>
<li>Women are much more likely to develop osteoporosis than are men. Lowered sex hormone levels tend to weaken bone. The reduction of oestrogen levels in women at menopause is one of the strongest risk factors for developing osteoporosis.</li>
<li>The old age people are at greater risk of osteoporosis.</li>
<li>Having a parent or sibling with osteoporosis puts greater risk to have osteoporosis</li>
<li>Low calcium intake contributes to diminished bone density, early bone loss and an increased risk of fractures.</li>
<li>Severely restricting food intake and being underweight weakens bone in both men and women.</li>
<li>Long-term use of oral or injected corticosteroid medications, such as prednisone and cortisone, interferes with the bone-rebuilding process.</li>
</ol>
<p>OR<br />

<p>Question 20.<br />
What is league tournament? Draw a fixture of nine (9) teams on the basis of league tournament using cyclic method. Explain British method to declare the Winner. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
In a league tournament, each team competes with every other team participating in the tournament. Winners are decided on the basis of the points acquired after all the competitions. For each win a team may be awarded 2 points, for draw 1 point and for a loss no point is awarded. Formulae to find the number of matches in a league tournament = n (n &#8211; 1)/2, where n = number of teams participating in the tournament. The number of matches in a league tournament of 9 teams = 9 (9 -1)/2 = 36 matches. In a single league tournament, every team competes with every other team participating in the tournament once. In a double league tournament, every team competes with every other team participating in the tournament twice.</p>
<p>Advantages of league Tournament:</p>
<ol>
<li>Luck factor does not have a role to play as each team gets to play with all the teams.</li>
<li>If a good team has lost a match, it still can be winner of the tournament because it has other matches to play.</li>
<li>There is less pressure on players to perform well bacause each match is not crucial.</li>
<li>More number to matches for players to show their talent and also for the selectors to spot the talent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Disadvantages of league Tournament:</p>
<ol>
<li>It takes more time to finish the tournament. Number of matches in a league tournament is more compared to knock-out tournament.</li>
<li>It is not economical<br />
Each match is not crucial. So, some matches may become boring for sopectators</li>

Number of Matches = N(N-1)/2 = 9(9-1)/2= 36<br />
N = Number of teams</p>
<p>British Method to Decide the Winner<br />
In British method to decide winner in a league tournament, team which wins secures 2 points and for a draw 1 point and for a loss a team gets zero points.</p>
<p>Formulae for deciding the winner in a league tournament by British Method is number of points secured divided by maximum point which can be secured whole multiplied by 100. Percentage scored by a team = (Number of points secured/Maximum point which can be secured) 100</p>
<p>If there are 9 teams maximum points which can be scored by a team are 18 points (9 × 2) and the team which has secured 10 points will have a percentage score of (10/18 ) 100 is equal to 55 percentage. The team which has higher percentage will be considered winner.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
Explain macro-nutrients and their role in our diet. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Macronutrients are defined as chemical substances required in large amounts by the body for survival. The three macro-nutrients are protein, carbohydrates, and fats. The amounts of different macro-nutrients a person needs as well as the ratio of nutrients to each other varies by age, lifestyle (sedentary, active, or very active), gender, health status, and health goals.</p>

<p>Role of micro-nutrients in our diet :<br />
(a) Carbohydrates include starches, sugars, and fiber.<br />
(b) Body uses carbohydrates to fuel the body.<br />
(c) Carbohydrates come in two forms complex and simple. Simple carbohydrates include sugars like table sugar and high fructose corn syrup, which have one or two sugar molecules (mono- and disaccharides). Honey and maple syrup contain simple sugars, as well as other nutrients. Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple sugars stuck together, also called polysaccharides. They can be either starches or fiber (cellulose from plants). Foods like whole wheat pasta and white potatoes contain complex carbohydrates.<br />
(d) Adults should get between 45-65% of their daily calories from carbohydrates.<br />
(e) Humans don&#8217;t produce the enzymes necessary to digest fiber.<br />
(f) Sources of Carbohydrates : The best carbohydrates are micro nutrients dense whole foods that contain sugar or starches along with fiber. Breads, cereals, pasta, rice, beans and peas, and starchy vegetables such as potatoes, green peas, corn honey, candy, soft drinks, and frosting or icing are sources of carbohydrates.</p>
<p>(ii) Proteins<br />
(a) Protein is the building block responsible for the growth and maintenance of eyes, skin, hair, nails, organs, and muscle tissue.<br />
(b) During digestion, protein is broken down into smaller chains called polypeptides and individual units called amino acids for absorption. Of the 22 amino acids that make up proteins, nine are called &#8220;essential&#8221; amino acids, which means that our bodies do not produce them and must get them from food. These include histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine. Histidine is unique in that it is only required during infacy.<br />
(c) Protein embeds themselves in cells to regulate what goes in and out. They even envelop and transport some molecules to other locations in the body.<br />
(d) Enzymes that catalyze the various chemical reactions in the body are made of folded chains of amino acids.<br />
(e) The body creates hormones like leptin, immune proteins like interferon and antibodies using amino acids.<br />
(f) Sources of Protein<br />
Nuts, seeds, grains and vegetables, are called incomplete proteins because they do not contain all nine essential amino acids together, as meats, eggs and dairy products do. One won&#8217;t develop a protein deficiency on a plant-based diet as long as one eats a balanced died that combines plant foods with different amino acids.</p>
<p>(iii) Fat<br />
(a) Fat is the densest source of energy in the diet.<br />
(b) In the body, fats make up cell membranes, steroids, cholesterol, and 60% of the brain.<br />
(c) Fats support the absorption of fat soluble vitamins, cushion organs, and acts as largest form of energy storage.<br />
(d) Fats should account for 25-35% of the daily calories.<br />
(e) Dietary fats include saturated and unsaturated fats.<br />
(f) Saturated fats tend to come from animal sources, while most plant fats are unsaturated. There are also important essential fatty acids, namely omega-3 and omega-6. As with essential amino acids, the term essential means that the human body cannot produce it and we must get these from our diet. There is also an unnatural type of fat known as trans fats. Trans fats are often described as poison. Trans fat raise &#8220;bad&#8221; LDL cholesterol and have no place in a healthy diet.<br />
(g) Sources of Fat<br />
Nuts, seeds, avocados, olives, coconut, dark chocolate, grape seed oil, sunflower oil, walnut oil, sesame oil, coconut oils, meat are good source of fat.</p>

What do you know about Harvard Step Test? Explain its procedure and administration.<br />
Answer:<br />
The Harvard Step test is a test to test aerobic fitness :</p>
<p>Equipment required : Step or platform 20 inches / 50.8 cm high for men and 16 inches for women, stopwatch, and metronome or cadence tape. Things to be done before the test: Explain the test procedures to the subject. Perform screening of health risks and obtain informed consent. Prepare forms and record basic information such as age, height, body weight, gender, test conditions. Check step height and set metronome.</p>
<p>Procedure : The athlete steps up and down on the platform at a rate of 30 steps per minute (every two seconds) for 5 minutes or until exhaustion. Exhaustion is defined as when the athlete cannot maintain the stepping rate for 15 seconds. The athlete immediately sits down on completion of the test, and the total number of heart beats are counted between 1 to 1.5 minutes after finishing. This is the only measure required if using the short form of the test. If the long form of the test is being conducted, there is an additional heart rate measures at between 2 to 2.5 minutes, and between 3 to 3.5 minutes.</p>
<p>Scoring : The Fitness Index score is determined by the following equations :<br />
Fitness Index (short form) = (100 × test duration in seconds) divided by (5.5 × pulse count between 1 and 1.5 minutes).<br />
Fitness Index (long form) = (100 × test duration in seconds) divided by (2 × sum of heart beats in the recovery periods).</p>

What are the effects of exercise on Respiration System ? Write in detail. ** [5]</p>
<p>Question 25.<br />
What do you understand by fracture? How can fracture be classified? Explain. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
A bone fracture is a medical condition where the continuity of the bone is broken. A break in the bone that does not damage surrounding tissue or tear through the skin is known as a closed fracture. On the other hand, one that damages surrounding skin and penetrates the skin is known as a compound fracture or an open fracture.<br />
Classification of Fracture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comminuted fracture: The bone is shattered into many pieces.</li>
<li>Compression (crush) fracture : Generally occurs in the spongy bone in the spine. For example, the front portion of a vertebra in the spine may collapse due to osteoporosis.</li>
<li>Greenstick fracture : The bone partly fractures on one side, but does not break completely because the rest of the bone can bend. This is more common among children, whose bones are softer and more elastic.<sup>5</sup></li>
<li>Hairline fracture : A partial fracture of the bone. Sometimes this type of fracture is harder to detect with routine X-rays.</li>
<li>Impacted fracture : When the bone is fractured, one fragment of bone goes into another.</li>
<li>Longitudinal fracture : The break is along the length of the bone.</li>
<li>Oblique fracture : A fracture that is diagonal to a bone&#8217;s long axis.</li>
<li>Spiral fracture : A fracture where at least one part of the bone has been twisted.</li>
<li>Stress fracture : More common among athletes. A bone breaks because of repeated stresses and strains.</li>
<li>Transverse fracture : A straight break right across a bone.</li>

<p>Question 26.<br />
What do you understand by coordinative ability? Discuss about different types of coordinative abilities. [5]<br />
OR<br />
Write in detail about strength improving methodisometric, Isotonic and Isokinetic.<br />
Answer:<br />
Coordination is the ability to integrate separate motor systems with varying sensory modalities into efficient movements. The harmonious working together of the synchrony, rhythm, and sequencing aspect of one&#8217;s movements is crucial to coordinated movement. Various parts of the body may be involved, such as eye foot coordination, as in kicking a ball or walking upstairs. Eye-hand coordination is evident in fine motor activities such as bead stringing, tracing and clay modelling or in gross motor activities such as catching, striking or volleying a ball.</p>
<p>Different Types of Coordinative ability Following are different types of coordinative abilities :</p>
<p>(i) Coupling Ability : Coupling ability to synchronize movements and direction efficiently and to let different parts to cooperate in order to achieve a desired and smooth movement. Coupling ability of the body is considered as capacity of an individual to perform better coordination of different parts of the body. For example, while dribbling a basketball, the coordination of both the limbs is required.</p>
<p>(ii) Reaction Ability : Reaction ability is a skill to react quickly to a stimulus. For example, chaser in Kho-Kho runs quickly after Kho is given.</p>
<p>(iii) Balance Ability : Balance ability is known as capability of an individual to maintain balance while the body is in motion. Even during distributed balance regaining the lost balance is known as balance ability.</p>
<p>(iv) Orientation Ability : The orientation ability is a skill to determine and change the position in complex situations. For example, defending an opponent in football, the position is changed according to the movement of opponent.</p>
<p>(v) Adaptation Ability: Adaptation ability is the capability of a person to change the movement on the basis of predicted changes. This ability is achieved after mastering the skills.</p>
<p>(vi) Rhythm Ability : Rhythm ability is to make out motor actions on a well-defined rhythm. Rhythm ability enables to grasp and express rhythm which is externally determined or contained in the motor activity itself.<br />
OR<br />
Answer:<br />
(i) Isometric:<br />
They are exercises in which muscular tension is built without any visible movement of muscle being used. Contraction during such an exercise is called isometric contraction. Work done during isometric exercise is zero. Isometric exercise is practiced by pushing or pulling an immovable object like a wall or bar anchored to the floor. Isometric exercise increases muscle tension significantly but fails to change the length of the muscles. Today, it is primarily used for rehabilitation purposes.<br />
Examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balancing on one foot.</li>
<li>Pressing against the wall.</li>
<li>Standing with heavy load on head.</li>
<li>Maintaining a sitting posture without a chair.</li>
<li>Holding a weight at arm&#8217;s length.</li>
<li>Attempting to lift an immoveable object. Characteristic of isometric exercise
<ul>
<li>The amount of heat generated and tension developed is higher than that of isotonic.</li>
<li>Increased muscular tension leads to tremor in muscles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>(ii) Isotonic:<br />
Exercise where we can see movement of an object on application of force is called Isotonic exercise and contraction of the muscle during such an exercise is called isotonic contraction. Isotonic exercises are carried out against a fixed resistance. As each muscle moves through its complete range, isotonic contraction creates tension with maximum effort at the beginning and end of each exercise. Two types of muscular contraction take place while performing Isotonic exercise they are concentric contraction in which length of the muscle decreases from the normal size and eccentric contraction in which length of the muscle increases from the normal size.<br />
Examples :</p>
<table border="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="68">Light rhythmic exercise</td>
<td width="78">Running downhill</td>
<td width="67">Sit-ups and push up</td>
<td width="100">Lifting free weights, like dumbbells and barbells</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="68">Hammer throw</td>
<td colspan="2" width="145">Triple Jump</td>
<td width="100">Landing on the ground after a jump</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>(iii) Isokinetic:<br />
They are exercises in which speed remains same throughout the range of movement. It can be also called as a combination of isometric and isotonic contraction. Isokinetic exercise uses a machine that controls the speed of contraction within the range of motion. Cybex and Biodex machines provide this kind of workout, but these machines are generally used by physical therapists and not readily available to most people. Exercise which can be found similar to isokinetic exercise in sports activity are :</p>
<ol>
<li>Ice skating</li>
<li>Chin ups</li>
<li>Rope climbing</li>
<li>While Rowing</li>
<li>While Swimming</li>
</ol>
