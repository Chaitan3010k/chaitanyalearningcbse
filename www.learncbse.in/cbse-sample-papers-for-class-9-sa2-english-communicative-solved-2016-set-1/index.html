<strong>1.(a) Read the passage given below and complete the sentences that</strong> <strong>follow :</strong><br />
It was all about individual brilliance then; now it is just teamwork. Inflated egos ruled the dressing room then; now it is genuine camaraderie. It was exuberant emotionalism then; now it is refined professionalism. The Indian hockey team that won the gold in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games and the one that won gold in the Incheon games on October 2 are poles apart.<br />
The 1990s was a team of mega stars-Dhanraj Pillay, Mukesh Kumar, Ashish Ballal, Baljit Singh Dhillon. Their fight often went beyond the field-among themselves, with coaches and with the federation. It is not that the current team does not have stars. Captain Sardar Singh is among the most capped players in the world. Then there are veterans like Gurbaj Singh, Danish Mujtaba and S. V. Sunil. But the rock star among them is goalkeeper P. R. Sreejesh, who saved two penalty shots in the final against Pakistan. The team celebrated the victory with a quiet dinner at a local restaurant. Then they went back to the atheletes’ village and retired to their rooms.<br />
For all of them it was the first ‘real gold medal’. In fact, India had not won any big event since the Bangkok games. One man who was present then and now is a coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik. The current coaching team is led by high performance director Roelant Oltmans, chief coach Terry Walsh and coaches Kaushik and Jude Felix.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>(b) Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
The Bora tree grew tall, her flowers bloomed and yielded large, luscious, rosy fruit. But she was vain. She never even whispered to neighbouring trees and bushes. When the butterflies and bees came for nectar, she lifted her branches and swooshed them away. When the birds wanted to build nests in her branches she pricked them with her thorns. She saw that children loved her juicy fruit, so she angrily dropped her flowers and yielded only a few fruit.<br />
One day, the Great Creator came on a visit. All the trees greeted His coming and had joyous tales to tell. But the Bora tree tossed her head and said, “My Lord and Master, I found no one who deserved what you gave to me, so I saved my strength and bore less fruit. I sent the silly birds away because they would destroy the beauty of my branches with their messy nest material”.<br />
The Creator shook his head. “You did a foolish thing”. He said. “What about kindness, compassion and generosity ? What about service to others ? Have they no meaning for you ?” Even as the Lord spoke, the Bora’s fruit grew small and sour; so did the leaves. The bark became rough; thorns grew in plenty. To this day we see the Bora tree thus. As the result of selfishness-she lost what she had.<br />
1.On the basis of your reading of the passage, complete the following statements.<br />

<strong>1.(a) Read the passage given below and complete the sentences that</strong> <strong>follow :</strong><br />
It was all about individual brilliance then; now it is just teamwork. Inflated egos ruled the dressing room then; now it is genuine camaraderie. It was exuberant emotionalism then; now it is refined professionalism. The Indian hockey team that won the gold in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games and the one that won gold in the Incheon games on October 2 are poles apart.<br />
The 1990s was a team of mega stars-Dhanraj Pillay, Mukesh Kumar, Ashish Ballal, Baljit Singh Dhillon. Their fight often went beyond the field-among themselves, with coaches and with the federation. It is not that the current team does not have stars. Captain Sardar Singh is among the most capped players in the world. Then there are veterans like Gurbaj Singh, Danish Mujtaba and S. V. Sunil. But the rock star among them is goalkeeper P. R. Sreejesh, who saved two penalty shots in the final against Pakistan. The team celebrated the victory with a quiet dinner at a local restaurant. Then they went back to the atheletes’ village and retired to their rooms.<br />
For all of them it was the first ‘real gold medal’. In fact, India had not won any big event since the Bangkok games. One man who was present then and now is a coach Maharaj Krishan Kaushik. The current coaching team is led by high performance director Roelant Oltmans, chief coach Terry Walsh and coaches Kaushik and Jude Felix.</p>

2.saved two penalty shots in the final against Pakistan.<br />
3.high performance director Roelant Oltmans, chief coach Terry Walsh and two other coaches.<br />
4.Bangkok Asian Games.<br />
5.‘inflated’.<br />
<strong>(b) Read the following passage carefully.</strong><br />
The Bora tree grew tall, her flowers bloomed and yielded large, luscious, rosy fruit. But she was vain. She never even whispered to neighbouring trees and bushes. When the butterflies and bees came for nectar, she lifted her branches and swooshed them away. When the birds wanted to build nests in her branches she pricked them with her thorns. She saw that children loved her juicy fruit, so she angrily dropped her flowers and yielded only a few fruit.<br />
One day, the Great Creator came on a visit. All the trees greeted His coming and had joyous tales to tell. But the Bora tree tossed her head and said, “My Lord and Master, I found no one who deserved what you gave to me, so I saved my strength and bore less fruit. I sent the silly birds away because they would destroy the beauty of my branches with their messy nest material”.<br />
The Creator shook his head. “You did a foolish thing”. He said. “What about kindness, compassion and generosity ? What about service to others ? Have they no meaning for you ?” Even as the Lord spoke, the Bora’s fruit grew small and sour; so did the leaves. The bark became rough; thorns grew in plenty. To this day we see the Bora tree thus. As the result of selfishness-she lost what she had.<br />
1.On the basis of your reading of the passage, complete the following statements.<br />
(а)   The Bora tree justified her unhelpful and cruel attitude by saying that<br />
(b)   The Bora tree dropped her flowers because__________ .<br />
2.Answer the following questions.<br />

(b)What characteristics should the Bora tree have inculcated ?<br />
3.Find a word from the passage which means the same as ‘originator’.<br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.1.(a) no one deserved to have what God gave it.<br />
(b)children loved her juicy fruits.<br />
2.(a) The moral of the story is : don’t be selfish, but be kind and generous.<br />
(b) The tree should have inculcated kindness, compassion and generosity.<br />

<p><strong>2.Theme : “India’s Tryst with Mars” </strong><br />
<strong>For the Open Text Based Assessment (OTBA)</strong><br />
<strong>(а) How would the Mars Mission benefit the common people ? Give suitable observations and illustrative examples.</strong><br />
<strong>(b)  How does development occur ? When and how does a country become developed ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (a)         <strong> India’s Tryst with Mars</strong><br />
Man has always been fascinated with the planets in the solar system. The Mars Mission 2014 will showcase India’s rocket launch systems, spacecraft building and operational capabilities. It will help India design, plan, strengthen and manage the existing inter-planetary communication system. The Mars probe will explore the surface features, morphology and mineralogy of Mars. A study of the Martian atmosphere, topography and the effects of solar winds and radiation will be helpful in the future for navigation and communication. It will give Indian scientists know how to design new models of spacecraft, which will be more sophisticated and better able to deal with inter-planetary mission operation. The success of this mission and its publicity will drive more business towards India. Thus India will be able to capture the global market for spacecraft hardware and software. India will be in a position to earn precious foreign exchange by building and launching similar satellites for others. It will also provide a tremendous opportunity for young scientists to engage in the pursuit of space science and technology. A small step today may signify a giant leap for Indian technology in the future.<br />
(b) Development is the aim of every nation and every individual. Development is a multidimensional concept. A country develops when it is able to provide food, clothing and shelter to its people. Development means providing proper education, health care, employment and cultural facilities.<br />
When a country is able to provide a healthy environment and equal opportunities to all, it is on the road to development. Being able to defend its frontiers from hostile enemies ensuring economic stability and growth leads to good governance. When the government is efficient, it generates national pride among the people. It leads to unity, integration and development.</p>

<strong>3.Trees are being cut daily. Forests are being destroyed to provide space for houses, industries and roads. All this is greatly harming the environment. In an article for your school magazine, describe in 100­120 words, the harms caused by deforestation and the steps to be taken to check it.</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.                      The Harms of Deforestation</strong><br />
Deforestation means clearing the forests by cutting down or burning trees in a large number. This is done to build homes, roads, bridges, etc. for the comforts and needs of rising population. It has certainly harmful effects on the environment as well as our lives. In the absence of trees which breathe out oxygen, the atmosphere gets more polluted and hotter than before, leading to global warming. Global warming results in freak droughts, floods and storms that cause heavy damage to crops, property and life in general. Trees provide much-needed wood and medicinal material. When they are cut down, the poor people are badly hit. Trees also check soil erosion. When there is no check on soil erosion fertile lands go barren and food production is badly hit.<br />
Therefore, we must take immediate steps to check deforestation. If we need to cut trees in some areas, we should plant more in others. Plants around fields should be grown. People should be encouraged not to use wood for cooking. Alternative fuels should be provided. Some sorts of legal bans on cutting trees should be introduced and implemented strictly.</p>
<p><strong>4.Based on the following outlines, develop a short story in 150-200 words : </strong><br />

aliens invite him to visit planet_______ accompanies them_______ stays for two<br />
days_____ has wonderful time_____ returns two inches tall_____ parents and<br />
friends surprised_____ narrates experience.<br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. Vaibhav and his friends were camping in a hilly area. One morning he got up early and went for a walk in a nearby forest. In an open space he saw a strange, round object emitting red and blue lights. As he neared it, he saw two strange creatures like robots coming out of it. He got frightened. The two creatures invited him in his own language to accompany them to their planets VX. They assured him of a good experience and safe return.<br />
Vaibhav was basically a brave and adventurous boy. He followed the aliens to their craft. Soon it shot off at a great speed in the sky. After four or five hours he was asked to come out. He found himself on a new land. He saw small and big mansions. Aliens were engaged in several activities as men do on the earth. He was taken to a laboratory where experiments were being conducted. He was asked to lie down on a bed. He was given a sweet juice to drink and then an experiment was done on him. When he came back to his chamber he found himself taller by two inches and fairer than before.<br />
After two days his alien-friends took him back to earth. His friends were surprised to see him, and so were his parents. He narrated his strange experience to them. Some believed him but many did not.</p>

<p><strong>10.Answer the following question in about 80-100 words : </strong><br />
Marie’s role in the play helps us to understand the Bishop’s greatness and Persome’s simplicity. Discuss.<br />
Or<br />
Was Corporal Turnbull’s decision to assign cookhouse duties to Private Quelch a form of revenge or a just action ? Discuss the values Corporal Turnbull should have possessed in his treatment of Professor.<br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Marie is a minor character. Her interaction with Persome reveals the character traits of Persome and her brother, the benevolent Bishop. Marie’s conversation with Persome reveals that at heart Persome is a simple, loving sister. She is concerned that her brother is ruining himself in trying to help others. She has his welfare at heart.<br />
The Bishop’s sympathy, generosity and philanthropy is revealed in his simple gestures to Marie. He meets her ailing mother and offers her his comforter to shield her from the cold winds at night.<br />
Or<br />
Corporal Turnbull was a war veteran. The young trainees hero-worshipped him for his bravery and toughness. One day he was taking a lesson on the hand grenade. Private Quelch interrupted him and began to explain how the characteristics of the grenade should have been discussed first of all. Corporal<br />
Turnbull became red with embarrassment and told him to give the lecture. No doubt Private Quelch had more knowledge, but it was extremely tactless, rude and insulting on his part to find fault with his teacher. He must learn to be more respectful and obedient to his seniors. Corporal Turnbull wanted to discipline him. He therefore punished him by assigning him duties in the cookhouse. Corporal Turnbull should not have treated the professor so harshly. He should have patience, calm and poise. As a teacher, he should have been free from vindictiveness He should have forgiven his student’s behaviour. He could have used tactfulness to teach the Professor a lession in discipline.</p>

<p><strong>11.Answer the following question in about 150-200 words. </strong><br />
How does Gulliver describe the litigation in England to the Master Horse ?<br />
Or<br />
Pedro De Mendez emerges as one of the most attractive characters of the book. Comment.<br />
Or<br />
Do you think Montmorency enjoyed the company of the three friends in the story ? Why do you think so ?<br />
Or<br />
‘Montmorency had a fight with the kettle during tea time’. Narrate the incident in your own words.<br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Gulliver reached the country of Houyhnhnms. They were a breed of horses that were disciplined and rational. He learnt their language and communicated with them. He learnt about their customs and told them about the customs of his country, England. He told them that there were many crimes and evils in his country. The Judicial system was in a sorry state of affairs. The judges of the courts were corrupt. Lawyers were clever. They argued their client’s case in a clever way. It seemed that only the client was right, others were guilty. The judges were not fair or impartial. Judgements were given according to selfish interests. Lawyers indulged in all sorts of evil practices. They were trained to show that white is black and black is white. They were liars and misresented facts.<br />
Delays were common. It took years to settle a dispute. It took more than thirty years to decide property cases. The rightful heir had to show proof that his ancestors had left him the property for the last six generations. People had a violent desire to gain wealth, power and titles by fair and unfair means.<br />
Or<br />
Pedro De Mendez was a courteous and generous person. He rescued Gulliver and treated him with great patience, and tenderness. He allowed Gulliver to travel on his ship as far as Lisbon. He spoke to him gently and requested him to narrate his experiences. He offered his finest suit of clothes to replace Gulliver’s ragged and tattered clothes.<br />
Don Pedro was not judgemental. Though Gulliver was rude and unreasonable, the captain tried to change his behaviour in a persuasive manner. Very slowly he transformed a silent and sullen Gulliver into a communicative person. He offered him good food, wine and a clean cabin to sleep in. When Gulliver tried to jump into the sea, he persuaded him not to repeat the act. Don Pedro showed the same kind of generosity and understanding that Gulliver’s Houyhnhnm master had shown earlier. Yet Gulliver considered him repulsive. Guliver was unable to escape from his delusions.<br />
Don Pedro is a minor character but plays an important symbolic role. He is the touchstone through which we see that Gulliver was no longer a reliable and objective commentator of reality.<br />
Or<br />
Montmorency was a clever, adventurous and intelligent dog. He seemed to enjoy the company of the three friends in the novel. In fact, he wanted not to be away from them for long. He would listen to the talks of the friends attentively and would respond with approval or disapproval. For example, when the decision was taken to go on a boat trip, he did not like it and barked to register his disapproval, but his objection was ruled over. When the friends took the decision that they would sleep out for nights in a hotel or pub, he hailed the decision. Montmorency was in the habit of interfering in everything the friends did. When the packing was being done, he did not sit idle. He put his leg into the jam. He pretended that the lemons were rats and got into the hamper and ‘killed’ three of them before Harris stopped him from his misdeed.<br />
On the boat trip he was the fourth member of the party. He never missed any chance to enjoy the experience. Even the three friends seemed to like his company. That is why, they took him along. Had he been a nuisance to them, they could have easily left him home.<br />
Or<br />
Montmorency is a clever, adventurous, fox, terrier. He cannot let any challenge go unresponded. He is always fascinated when a kettle begins to boil.<br />
At Sonning, the three friends decide to boil water for tea in a kettle. When the water begins to boil, the kettle begins to steam and splutter. Montmorency regards this as a challenge. He seizes the opportunity to rush at the boiling kettle. He seizes it by the spout. His nose gets burnt. He gives a yelp and leaves the boat. He takes three rounds of the island at a fast speed. To cool his nose, he would bury it in the cool mud. From that day he begins to regard the kettle with hatred and suspicion.<br />
It is one of the most humorous incidents of the novel. We chuckle and laugh at the plight of the poor dog.</p>
