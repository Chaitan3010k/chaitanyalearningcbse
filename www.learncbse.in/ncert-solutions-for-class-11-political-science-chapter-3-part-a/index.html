<p>Question 5.<br />
What is the difference between the system of reservation of constituencies and the system of separate electorate? Why did the Constitution makers reject the latter?<br />
Answer:<br />
There is much difference between the system of reservation of constituencies and system of separate electorate:<br />
Separate electorate system:</p>
<ul>
<li>It has been a curse to India.</li>
<li>The British started this system to divide votes between the Sikhs, the Muslims, and some other minorities.</li>
<li>These groups elected their own representatives by separate vote.</li>
<li>In separate electorate system, the candidates are elected by those voters, who belong to that particular community.</li>
</ul>
<p>System of reservation of constituencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>All voters are eligible to vote.</li>
<li>Candidate must belong to a particular community for which seat is reserved.</li>
<li>The constitution provides the reservation of seats in the Lok Sabha and the State Legislative Assemblies. The constitution-makers rejected the latter because they were aware that the system of separate electorate destroyed the spirit of national integration.</li>
</ul>

(b) This is correct statement<br />
(c) This is incorrect because the President can remove an Election Commissioner.<br />
(d) This is also incorrect. The correct statement is the appointment of more than one Election Commissioner is not mandatory.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Indian electoral system aims at ensuring representation of socially disadvantaged sections. However, we are yet to have even 10 per cent women members in our legislatures. What measures would you suggest to improve the situation?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Indian Constitution provides the reservation for SC&#8217;s and ST&#8217;s in our legislative&#8217;s. But it lacks the similar reservation for disadvantaged groups.

<p>Question 9.<br />
A former Chief Election Commissioner joined a political party and contested elections. There are various views on this issue. One view is that a former Election Commissioner is an independent citizen and has a right to join any political party and to contest election. According to the other view, leaving this possibility open can affect the impartiality of the Election Commission. So, former Election Commissioners must not be allowed to contest any elections. Which position do you agree with and why?<br />
Answer:<br />
Election Commission of India is a constitutional independent body set for conducting elections of the Union Parliament, the state Legislative Assembly, President and Vice President under the Article 324(i) of India Constitution. The Election Commission is an impartial agency to conduct free and fair elections in country. Hence, Election Commissioner must not be allowed to contest any election because it can affect the impartiality of the Commission.</p>

<ul>
