<h3>Class 11 Political Science Chapter 2 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Write true or false against each of these statements:<br />
(a) A Bill of Rights lays down the rights enjoyed by the people of a country.<br />
(b) A Bill of Rights protects the liberties of an individual.<br />
(c) Every country of the world has a Bill of Rights.<br />
(d) The Constitution guarantees remedy against violation of Rights.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) True<br />
(b) True<br />
(c) False<br />
(d) True</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Which of the following is the best description of Fundamental Rights?<br />
(а) All the rights an individual should have.<br />
(b) All the rights given to citizens by law.<br />
(c) The rights given and protected by the Constitution.<br />
(d) The rights given by the Constitution that cannot ever be restricted.<br />
Answer:<br />
(c) The rights given and protected by the Constitution.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Read the following situations. Which Fundamental Right is being used or violated in each case and how?<br />
(a) Overweight male cabin crew are allowed to get promotion in the national airlines but their women colleagues who gain weight are penalised.<br />
(b) A director makes a documentary film that criticises the policies of the government.<br />
(c) People displaced by a big dam take out a rally demanding rehabilitation.<br />
(d) Andhra society runs Telugu medium schools outside Andhra Pradesh.<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) In this situation, Right to Equality is being violated on the ground of discrimination whereas nobody should be discriminated under the Right to Equality on behalf of Caste, Sex, Religion, Race, etc.<br />
(b) In the second situation the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression is being used.<br />
(c) People displaced by a big dam take out a rally demanding rehabilitation. Though our Constitution grants right to reside and settle in any part of India in the Right to Freedom. But people have Right to Freedom of speech and expression also. In this case, the government can impose some restrictions to maintain law and order.<br />
(d) This case refers to the rights of linguistic minorities to set up their own educational institutions to preserve their culture. Hence, Andhra Pradesh can enjoy the right to run Telugu medium schools outside Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
Which of the following is a correct interpretation of the Cultural and Educational Rights?<br />
(a) Only children belonging to the minority group that has opened educational institution can study there.<br />
(b) Government schools must ensure that children of the minority group will be introduced to their belief and culture.<br />
(c) Linguistic and religious minorities can open schools for their children and keep it reserved for them.<br />
(d) Linguistic and religious minorities can demand that their children must not study in any educational institution except those managed by their own community.<br />
Answer:<br />
(c) The statement of the above options is the correct interpretation because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article 29(i) protects the interest of minorities in India to preserve their own languages, script and culture.</li>
<li>Article 30 provides that all minorities shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Which of the following is a violation of Fundamental Rights and why?<br />
(a) Not paying minimum wages<br />
(b) Banning of a book<br />
(c) Banning of loudspeakers after 9 pm.<br />
(d) Making a speech<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Not paying minimum wages is a violation of Fundamental Right because:</p>
<ul>
<li>This act comes under Right against Exploitation.</li>
<li>Begar, forced labour, bonded labour or not paying minimum wages come under the Right against Exploitation.</li>
<li>It has now been declared a crime and a punishable offence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
An activist working among the poor says that the poor don’t need Fundamental Rights. What they need are Directive Principles to be made legally binding. Do you agree with this? Give your reasons.<br />
Answer:<br />
The most basic necessities of poor people are food, cloth and shelter. Hence, we can say that the activist is partly correct in saying that the poor don’t need Fundamental Right.<br />
Directive principles contain various non-justicable rights on which livelihood of poor depends:</p>
<ul>

Answer:<br />
After reading Somnath Lahiri’s statement (on page 36 NCERT Textbook). We agree with Lahiri’s views because a police constable vigil over unlawful activities to maintain law and order into the society. Maximum fundamental rights work under this framework only as if, these are violated and requires remedial order by the court later on. These rights do not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right to adequate livelihood</li>
<li>Equal pay for equal work</li>
<li>Right to work</li>
<li>Right against Economic Exploitation</li>
</ul>
<p>These are substantive to human life and should be incorporated as fundamental rights of people.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Which of the Fundamental Rights is in your opinion the most important right? Summarise its provisions and give arguments to show why it is most important.<br />
Answer:<br />
In my opinion, the Right to Constitutional Remedies is considered as the ‘heart and soul’ of Constitution, hence important, because:</p>
<p>A citizen can approach to the Supreme court or High court under this right, in case of violation of any of the  fundamental rights.</p>
<p>The court can issue some special orders for the enforcement of these fundamental rights under the title of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Habeas corpus</li>
<li>Mandamus</li>
<li>Prohibition</li>
<li>Quo Warranto</li>
<li> Certiorari</li>
</ul>
<p>Under the above mentioned writs, the fundamental rights are defendable.</p>
