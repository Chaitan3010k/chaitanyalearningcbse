<h3 style="text-align: center;">The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse Questions from Textbook Solved</h3>
<p><strong>A. Reading With Insight</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span><br />
</strong>You will probably agree that this story does not have breathless adventure and exciting action. Then what in your opinion makes it interesting?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The story ‘The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse’ is a tale told from the viewpoint of a nine-year old boy. At that age, imagination is rich and one can romanticise even insignificant actions. To such a person the world is full of excellence and glory and life is delightful and a mysterious dream. For the young poor boy, a ride on a beautiful white horse is a dream fulfilled. He had been always longing to ride and his cherished dream is realised when his cousin Mourad offers him a chance to ride on horseback—first with him and then alone. Riding the stolen horse and hiding it safely are great feats of adventure for the two boys.</p>
<p>Though the story line is thin, we eagerly follow the course of action taken by the boys till they return the horse to its rightful owner. The story provides us a peep into child psychology. For boys who are crazy about horses, stealing a horse for a ride is not stealing. Though they enjoy the thrill of riding, they are conscious of their family pride. The Garoghlanian family is well-known for honesty and trust. They would neither steal nor take advantage of anybody in the world. Another point of interest is characterization. The delineation of the common traits of uncle Khosrove and cousin Mourad is superb. The story also contains many purple passages full of pictorial description. All these heighten its appeal to the reader.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span><br />
</strong> Did the boys return the horse because they were conscience-stricken or because they were afraid?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The story gives no indication that the boys were afraid of anyone or anything. Hence the return of the horse was not directed by fear. Secondly, they were not at all conscience-stricken. They did not feel any pangs of repentance or remorse at their action of stealing a horse solely for the purpose of riding it. The narrator makes it amply clear when he asserts that stealing a horse for a ride was not the same thing as stealing something else, such as money. For him, it wasn&#8217;t stealing at all as he and Mourad were so crazy about horses. In his opinion, it would become stealing only when they offered to sell the horse, which he knew they would never do.</p>
<p>The last phrase gives a clue to their mental make up. Mourad had the horse for over a month when farmer John Byro visited the narrator’s house. They retained it for two weeks more. Mourad outrightly rejected the narrator’s suggestion of keeping the horse any longer. It was his family pride that would not let him steal. He decided that the horse must go back to its true owner. The meeting with John Byro proved conclusive. He praised their family for its honesty. He trusted the boys as he knew their parents. Hence in order to uphold the family tradition and reputation, the boys returned the horse to its rightful owner.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span><br />
</strong>“One day back there in the good old days when I was nine and the world was full of every imaginable kind of magnificence, and life was still a delightful and mysterious dream&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;. The story begins in a mood of nostalgia. Can you narrate some incident from your childhood that might make an interesting story?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
I had just completed my primary education when I visited my uncle. He was a forest ranger in Dehradun. In those days there was a thick forest in the vicinity of the city and all sorts of wild animals prowled there. Uncle had advised us not to enter the deep forest, but forbidden fruit is sweet; My cousin Varun, a couple of his friends and I decided to explore the southern range. We had the kits of scouts and were fully prepared.</p>
<p>In our boyish enthusiasm, we went deep into the jungle and reached a gorge. We were amazed to see a lioness with her cubs. One of us, perhaps, Mohit clicked his camera. The flashlight scared the lioness and she roared and leaped. Fortunately there was a big ditch and she fell into it. Meanwhile, we lit our torches, collected dry leaves and twigs and set them on fire. Momentarily, we got respite from our attackers. Then we threw some green leaves on fire to give smoke signal. A patrol party noticed it and rescued us. I shudder whenever I think of this adventure when we were close to death.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:</span><br />
</strong>The story revolves around characters who belong to tribe in Armenia. Mourad and Aram are members of the Garoghlanian family. Now locate Armenia and Assyria on the atlas and prepare a write-up on the Garoghlanian tribes.

<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Garoghlanian Tribes</strong></p>
<p>The Garoghlanian family was an Armenian tribe. Eleven centuries ago it was the wealthiest family in that part of the world. However, now every branch of the Garoghlanian tribe was living in the most amazing and comical poverty in the world. These poor people had no money. Nobody could understand where they ever got money enough to keep them with food in their bellies. The Garoghlanian tribes were famous for their honesty.</p>
<p>It had been the hallmark of the tribe for many centuries. They were proud of their family. Honesty came next and then they believed in right and wrong. None of them would take advantage of anybody in the world. No member of the Garoghlanian family could be a thief. The elders felt pained to remember that they had lost their homeland. These people shifted their residence from one place to the other. The narrator says, “That year we lived at the edge of the town, on Walnut Avenue.” They loved countryside having vineyards, orchards, olives and Walnuts. The names of the people are semi- Arabic: Mourad, Aram, Khosrove etc.</p>

</strong>What conflicting thoughts passed through the narrator’s mind on seeing Mourad on a beautiful white horse early one morning?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The narrator was surprised. He knew that his cousin Mourad couldn’t have bought the horse. Since he couldn’t have bought it, he must have stolen it. However, family pride came in the way. He refused to believe that he had stolen it.</p>

</strong>Give examples to show why cousin Mourad was considered one of the craziest members of the narrator’s family?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Cousin Mourad had a crazy streak. He was quite crazy about horses. He kept the stolen white horse for about six weeks, rode it, loved it, fed it well and hid it in a deserted yard. When he sang in the open countryside, it seemed as if he were roaring.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 10:</span><br />
</strong>Why does the narrator mention uncle Khosrove? Which characteristic features of the man are highlighted?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Cousin Mourad seemed to inherit the crazy streak of uncle Khosrove. He was a big man with a powerful head of black hair and very large moustache. He was quite furious in temper, very irritable and impatient. He would stop anyone from taking by roaring his pet phrase, “It is no harm; pay no attention to it”.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 11:</span><br />
</strong>Give an example to illustrate how uncle Khosrove’s impatience sometimes worked to his own disadvantage?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Once uncle Khosrove was getting his moustache trimmed in a barber’s shop. Suddenly their house was on fire. His own son Arak ran eight blocks to the barber’s shop to inform him. Khosrove got impatient and roared at his son. When the barber reminded him that his house was on fire, Khosrove roared at him and stopped him from talking.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 12:</span><br />
</strong>“The distribution of the various kinds of spirit of our tribe had been from the beginning capricious and vagrant.” Elucidate.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The Garoghlanian family had a crazy streak. Mourad was considered the natural descendant of uncle Khosrove as far as the crazy streak was concerned. Mourad’s father, Zorab was practical and nothing else. But Mourad was his son only in flesh; in spirit, he was similar to uncle Khosrove.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 13:</span><br />
</strong> Give a brief account of Mourad’s joy ride.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Mourad kicked his heels into the horse and shouted, “Vazire run!” The horse stood on its hind legs, snorted, and ran forward at full speed. Mourad raced the horse across a field of dry grass to an irrigation ditch. He crossed the ditch on the horse. When he returned five minutes later he was dripping wet.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 14:</span><br />
</strong> How did Aram, the narrator, fare in his solo ride?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer:<br />
</strong></span>Aram leaped to the back of the horse, but it did not move. Then he kicked into the muscles of the horse. It reared and snorted. Then it began to run. Aram did not know how to ride. The horse ran down the road to a vineyard. It leaped over seven vines, threw the rider and ran away.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 15:</span><br />
</strong>“We’ll either take him back or hide him until tomorrow morning”. Which course of action did the speaker take and why?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Mourad took the latter option. He hid the horse in the bam of a deserted vineyard which at one time had been the pride of farmer named Fetvajian. There were some oats and dry alfalfa in the bam. So Mourad did not seem worried about the horse.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 16:</span><br />
</strong> “I have an understanding with a horse.”<br />
“Horses understand me.”<br />
“I have a way with a horse. ”<br />
How do you think, had Mourad developed an understanding with the horse and what was the result?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Mourad had been quite tender and affectionate towards the horse. He would put his arms around it, press his nose into the horse’s nose and pat it. It was not easy to tame someone else’s horse and get it to behave nicely. At first, it wanted to run wild. Gradually, Mourad was able to control the horse and do what he wanted. Even John Byro, the rightful owner, admitted that the horse had become better-tempered and stronger than ever.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 17:</span><br />
</strong> Contrast the two visitors to narrator’s house who visited them one afternoon.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Uncle Khosrove was irritable, impatient and furious in temper. He stopped anyone from talking by roaring: “It’s no harm; pay no attention to it&#8221;. Farmer John Byro was a lonely Assyrian. He was sad at the loss of his horse and the uselessness of his surrey without a horse.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 18:</span><br />
</strong> How did uncle Khosrove react to John Byro’s complaint about the steal of his horse?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
John Byro was sad that his white horse had been stolen last month and it was missing even then. Instead of showing any sympathy, uncle Khosrove became very irritated and shouted: “It’s no harm. What is the loss of a horse?&#8230; What is this crying over a horse?”</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 19:</span><br />
</strong> What arguments did farmer John Byro advance to prove the usefulness of a horse to a country dweller?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
First, his surrey was no good without a horse. Second, he had to walk ten miles to get there and his left leg pained him. Thirdly, that horse had cost him sixty dollars. A city dweller like Khosrove may not realise the importance of a horse.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 20:</span><br />
</strong> Why did farmer John Byro stalk out of the house, slamming the screen door?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Farmer John Byro visited the narrator’s house. He was homesick, sad and lonely. His horse had been stolen for over a month. Instead of showing any sympathy or concern for his loss, uncle Khosrove repeated his catchword: “It’s no harm. Pay no attention to it”. When John Byro talked about the cost of horse, uncle Khosrove commented: “I spit on money.” This was too much for John Byro to bear and so he left the house in disgust.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 21:</span><br />
</strong> How did Mourad help the wounded Robin to fly? What does this incident indicate?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span> The narrator noticed Mourad trying to cure the hint wing of a young robin which could not fly. He was talking to the bird. After sometime, he threw the bird into the air. The bird tried hard and almost fell twice. However, at last it flew away, high and straight. This incident shows that in spite of having a crazy streak, Mourad was kind at heart and gentle towards God’s creatures.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 22:</span><br />
</strong>What request did the narrator make to his cousin Mourad about the horse? How did he react to it? What does this reveal?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The narrator requested his cousin Mourad not to return the horse to farmer John Byro till he learnt to ride. Mourad observed that it might take him a year. The narrator suggested to keep the horse for a year. Mourad shouted that he was inciting him to steal. He declared that the horse must go back to its true owner. This shows his honesty and sense of family pride.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 23:</span><br />
</strong> What did farmer John Byro observe after studying the horse the two boys had with them?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The farmer studied the horse eagerly and asked its name. Mourad said that they called it “My Heart’. John Byro appreciated it as a lovely name for a lovely horse. He was ready to swear that it was the horse that was stolen hum him many weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 24:</span><br />
</strong>“A suspicious man would believe his eyes instead of his heart.&#8221; In what context was this observation made and by whom?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span> </strong><br />
This observation was made by farmer John Byro after looking into the mouth of the horse. It matched his horse tooth for tooth. He would have claimed it as his own horse if he had not known their parents or the fame of their family for honesty. The resemblance was so striking that he called it the twin of his horse.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 25:</span><br />
</strong> What do you think, induced the boys to return the horse to its owner?<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span> </strong><br />
The boys were impressed by John Byro’s attitude towards their parents and family. He knew their parents very well and so believed whatever the boys said. Secondly, the fame of their family for honesty was well-known to him. The boys returned the horse to him for the sake of family pride and dignity.</p>
<h3>The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse Long Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 1:</span><br />
</strong> Narrate the story ‘The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse’ in your own words.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
One summer morning narrator’s cousin Mourad came to his house at four in the morning and woke him up by tapping on the window of his room. The narrator was surprised to see Mourad sitting on a beautiful white horse. Mourad asked him to be quick if he wanted to ride. The narrator, Aram, longed to ride and jumped down to the yard from the window and leaped up onto the horse behind his cousin Mourad.</p>
<p>Since these Armenian families were quite poor, Aram concluded that Mourad must have stolen the horse. They rode and Mourad sang. Then Mourad had a joy ride alone. It seamed he had a way with a horse, for when Aram tried to ride alone, the horse threw him off and ran away. Since it was broad daylight, Mourad hid the horse in the ham of a deserted vineyard. That afternoon, farmer John Byro visited the narrator’s house and related his plight. His white horse had been missing for over a month.</p>
<p>Uncle Khosrove silenced him with his roaring commands. Aram reported everything to Mourad and requested him to keep the horse till he learnt to ride. Mourad did not agree. A chance meeting with farmer John Byro after a fortnight firmed up his decision. John Byro had believed the boys since he knew their fathers and was fully aware of the fame of their family for honesty. Mourad returned the horse to its owner then next morning.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 2:</span><br />
</strong> Relate some of the humorous incidents in the story. Which incident do you find the most amusing and why?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
The incidents related to uncle Khosrove are quite amusing. The repetition of his pet catchword: “It is no harm; pay no attention to it” causes humour whenever it is used in an incongruous context. For example, his own son Arak ran eight blocks to the barber shop where Khosrove was having his moustache trimmed to tell him that their house was on fire. This was a serious matter. Instead of leaving the place, he roared: “It is no harm; pay no attention to it.”</p>
<p>When the barber explained that his son was saying that his house was on fire, Khosrove silenced him by roaring: “It is no harm”. At the end of the story, uncle Khosrove again became irritated and shouted at farmer John Byro to be quiet. He said, “Your horse has been returned. Pay no attention to it.” The incongruity is obvious. The most amusing incident is the conversation between farmer John Byro and uncle Khosrove when the farmer sighed sadly and bewailed the stealth of his horse.</p>
<p>Uncle Khosrove remarked, “It is no harm. What is the loss of a horse? What is this crying over a horse?” John Byro tried to explain that his surrey was useless without a horse. Pat came Khosrove’s catchward “Pay no attention to it.” This phrase is repeated when the farmer complained that his left leg hurt him. When John Byro said that the horse had cost him sixty dollars, Khosrove remarked, “I spit on money.” The incident ends as John Byro walked out angrily slamming the screen door.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 3:</span><br />
</strong> What impression do you form of cousin Mourad?<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Mourad is a young boy of thirteen. He belongs to the Garoghlanian family of Armenia. Their whole tribe was poverty stricken. In spite of abject poverty, their family was famous for honesty. Mourad was quite adventurous and had a crazy streak in him. He enjoyed being alive more than anybody else. Mourad loved horse riding. He had a way with a horse. He had tamed the horse by his affectionate behaviour and now the horse was no longer wild.</p>
<p>It obeyed Mourad faithfully. His love for the horse is evident in the last scene. While parting, he put his arms around the horse, pressed his nose into the horse’s nose and patted it. He also had a way with dogs. The dogs of John Byro followed them around without making a sound. He was kind. He treated a young robin which had hurt its wing. He was worldly-wise and knew how to talk to farmers. Though he loved horse-riding he was averse of keeping the horse for a long time. He is proud of his family which is well known for their honesty and trust. In short, he is a lovable chap.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 4:</span><br />
</strong> Comment on the role of Aram, the narrator, in the story.<br />
<strong><span style="color: #008000;">Answer:</span> </strong><br />
Aram plays an important role in the story. Besides being the narrator, he is also a commentator. He not only narrates the various adventures, incidents and actions, but also provides useful information regarding the main characters and their behaviour. In fact, he is the fulcrum on which the whole story rests. He gives a graphic description of the Garoghlanian tribe, its members, their traits and economic features.</p>
<p>Mom-ad’s father Zorab is described as a practical person, whereas Mourad and uncle Khosrove represent the crazy streak in the tribe. Abject poverty of the family does not diminish his pride in his family which is famous for honesty. He says, “No member of the Garoghlanian family could be a thief.” He makes a fine distinction between stealing a horse for a ride and stealing a horse to sell it off. He gives a fine description of the horse ride and country side with its vineyards, orchards, irrigation ditches and country roads.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #eb4924;">Question 5:</span><br />
</strong> Compare and contrast uncle Khosrove and cousin Mourad.<br />
<span style="color: #008000;"><strong> Answer: </strong></span><br />
Uncle Khosrove and cousin Mourad have one very important point in common— their craziness. Mourad was considered the natural descendant of uncle Khosrove in this respect. The second similarity is their dominating nature. Both use pet words and phrases and roar aloud to quieten the hearer. While uncle Khosrove says, “It is no harm; pay no attention to it,” Mourad boasts, “I have a way with horses/dogs/farmers.”</p>
<p>Khosrove shouts at his son Arak, the barber and farmer John Byro. The narrator is a patient listener to Mourad’s assertions. The difference lies in their age groups and physical build up. Uncle Khosrove, a middle aged person is an enormous man with a powerful head of black hair and very large moustache. Mourad is an athletic young chap of thirteen. Khosrove is irritable, impatient and furious in temper. Mourad is reasonable in conversation.</p>
