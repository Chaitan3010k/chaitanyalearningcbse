Sub &#8211; Need of Zebra crossing and traffic lights<br />
Sir,<br />
Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper, I want to draw the attention of the concerned authorities to the problem of unruly traffic in front of our school.<br />
The road near New Age School is always jam packed. Everybody seems to be a road racer. Increasing vehicles and indisciplined driving make it difficult for the students to cross the road while going back to home. Multitudes of vehicles, scooters, cars, three wheelers, block the road as there is no traffic light. Patience, courtesy and sympathy seem to have gone away from the minds of drivers.<br />
It is in the safety and interest of students if concerned authorities install traffic light on this junction and also mark zebra crossing. This will ensure safety of the students.<br />
I hope, the concerned authorities will take action and do the needful.<br />
Yours faithfully Amit/Anita<br />

IMPORTANCE OF MORNING WALK<br />
By Amit / Anita<br />
Walking has its own delights. One gets optimum benefits from walking. &#8216;Sound mind in a sound body&#8217; is the saying that stresses the need of remaining healthy. Walking has its own contribution to make a person healthy. It is the easiest, the cheapest and the best way to remain fit and healthy. It has many benefits. It is a panacea for our survival. While taking a walk, we get pure and clean air that provides life to our lungs and rejuvenates power in our mind. A walk in the morning helps in regulating our blood circulation and regenerates our lost energy. Most of the ailments in our body subside, stress reduces and we become tension free. It regulates our appetite and smoothens our digestive system. The chirping of the birds, calm atmosphere, greenery and blooming flowers add charm and life to our survival. Nature uplifts our mood. Being in nature is like a communication with God. We should enjoy and avail this very gift of God provided<br />
to human beings and make full use of our legs to keep ourselves fit. It gives a headstart of the day.</p>

Complete the story in 150 &#8211; 200 words which begins as the following:<br />
It was a family picnic. The picnic spot was the<br />
bank of a river<br />
Answer:<br />
THE MONKEY&#8217;S JUSTICE<br />
One day two cats found a loaf of bread. Both of them were very hungry. The first cat wanted to have it all for himself. He jumped at it and picked it up. Another one tired to snatch it away from him.</p>
<p>The first cat asked him to keep away as he was the first one to pick it up. But the other cat claimed that he had seen it first so it was his. Both of them wanted to have it and were not able to divide.</p>
<p>Just then a monkey was passing by. He understood the problem. He offered to help and settle their problem. He said that he will give two equal parts of the bread to each one of them.</p>
<p>The cats agreed and let him solve the issue. They gave him the bread. The monkey made two parts of the bread. Then he shook his head and said, &#8220;These two parts are not equal. This one is bigger than the other one.&#8217; He ate a bit of the bigger part. But again the parts were not equal. So he ate a bit of the bigger part again to make the two parts equal. This went on till only small pieces of the bread were left. Then the monkey said to the cats that it was his fee and he ate those small pieces too and went away. The foolish cats were left hungry.<br />

It was a family picnic. The picnic spot was the bank of a river. We went there by car. We had taken fruits, sweets, sandwiches and biscuits with us. Our plan was to go for boating. When we reached there, we selected a shady tree to sit and spread our mats under it. First, we took some snacks and then played games. After a round of games, we started singing songs. It was when we were singing, my younger brother noticed some smoke at a distance. It was coming from a flour mill. Initially, we did not pay any attention to it. But then we could see thin flames also in the rear part of the building too. Slowly, it took a bigger shape. Now, there was panic all over. Employers of the mill were running here and there.<br />
We were horrified. My father and uncle went towards the site to see how they can help in this situation. They sent for a fire brigade. Workers of the mill were using fire extinguishers to bring the fire in control. But their attempts to quench the fire seemed useless.</p>
<p>Machines began to crack. Sparks of fire were spreading and clouds of smoke could be seen in the air. Then to the relief of everyone, there came the fire brigade. The people in fire brigade bravely fought with the flames and at last, the fire was brought under control. When we reached near the scene of destruction, we were horrified. Beams and machines were all rolled into the heap. There was a chaos everywhere. Smell of the smoke was nauseating. It was a tragic scene. Few workers had been badly burnt. They were rushed to the hospital. After helping the people over there, we came back home with a heavy heart. Devastation and cries of the people still echoes in my head.</p>

Whenever we want to achieve something difficulties always come in our way. What did Valli have to do to go and ride in a bus ?<br />
OR<br />
Education is always a great asset in the life of a woman. How did Bholi, an educated girl, face the challenge posed by Bishambar&#8217;s greed ?<br />
Answer:<br />
Ambition is the key to the fulfillment of one&#8217;s needs. One must always be ambitious in life. Valli was a simple girl who had ambitions. Her greatest ambition or her growing desire was to ride a bus. This desire stemmed from watching the bus pass through her village everyday. All this intrigued her. To undertake her first bus journey, she did her bit of research. She watched the bus, took a note of its schedule and listened to people&#8217;s conversations about their journey by bus. She even found out the fare of the bus, which was 30 paise for a trip. Gradually, she used all of this information to collect money for the bus fare as well as to undertake her first bus journey.</p>
<p>Education is always a great asset especially in the life of a woman. Education brings about a change in the quality of life of a woman. Education also helps in changing the outlook of a woman, the way she perceives things and how she responds to situations. Bholi was a simple girl. She had pockmarks on her face as a result of which, she was shunned for her looks. Her parents as well as the villagers neglected her. She was sent to school where she received great encouragement from her teacher. Despite her education, she did not get any marriage prospects mainly due to her looks. Bishambar, her prospective husband, was a lame old man who was greedy for Bholi&#8217;s money. Bholi however, took a bold step and rejected Bishambar&#8217;s marriage proposal. She promised to serve her parents in their old age and went back to teach in the school in which she studied.</p>

THE FOX AND THE GRAPES<br />
Once there was a fox. He was very hungry. He went into a garden in search of food. After looking for a while, he found a grapevine. He saw bunches of riped grapes hanging on the vines and his mouth started watering. Somehow, he wanted to eat those grapes. He jumped and stretched out to reach the grapes but he found them rather too high. So he jumped again to pluck them but couldn&#8217;t reach.</p>
<p>He tried to pluck the grapes many times but all went in vain. All his efforts to reach the grapes failed. He continued his efforts till he got completely tired. Then there came a point of time when he became hopeless. He gave up and said, &#8220;The grapes are sour. Who wants sour grapes?&#8221; The fox hated the grapes as he couldn&#8217;t have them.<br />

THE BEAR ENCOUNTER<br />
Ram and Mohan, two brothers, studied in a village school. One day they were returning from the school. On the way, there was a forest. One day, when they were coming back from the school, something strange happened. When they reached in the middle of the forest, they heard the rustling of grass. They assumed that some wild animal was there. Soon, a bear appeared in front of them. The bear was approaching them. Both were in panic.</p>
<p>One of them ran and climbed up a tree. But the other one couldn&#8217;t run and climb. When he could not make out what to do, he laid down and pretended to be dead. The bear came, stopped, sniffed him and thought that he was dead. He left him and went away. The second brother who was lying on the ground, heaved a sigh of big relief. Now, the brother who had climbed up the tree came down. He was happy that he had climbed up the tree. He asked his brother what the bear had said to him in his ears. He gave him a curt reply and said that the bear had told him never to trust selfish people even if they are your own blood. The boy felt very ashamed of leaving his brother alone in time of danger. He realised his mistake and asked his brother to pardon him. [1 × 3 = 3]</p>

Answer:<br />
A THIRSTY CROW<br />
It was the month of June. On a hot summer day, there was a crow who was very thirsty. His mouth was dry. His throat was burning. He flew from place to place in search of water but he could not find a single drop of water anywhere. After searching for a while he sat down disappointed. Rivers and lakes had all dried up.</p>
<p>At last, at a distance, he saw a jar of water. It was lying near a house. He went there and looked into it. It was half full. He could see the water but his beak could not reach it. He was frustrated.</p>
<p>Then an idea came into his mind. There were stones around. He picked up small stones, one by one, from the ground and dropped them into the jug. The water started coming up. Slowly, the water level rose to such a level that he could reach it easily. He drank the water, cawed happily and flew away.<br />
Hence, the thirsty crow proved that where there is a will, there is a way.<br />
