<p>Question 19.<br />
What is meant by deforestation? what are the causes of deforestation?<br />
Answer:<br />
Deforestation is the removal of a forest or strands of trees where the land is thereafter converted to a non-forest use. Examples of deforestation include conversion of forestland to farms, ranches, or urban use.</p>
<p>The conversion of forests into agricultural plantations is a major cause of deforestation. The increase in global demand for commodities, such as palm oil and soybeans, are driving industrial-scale producers to clear forests at an alarming rate. Livestock ranching and forest clearing for livestock ranching is another contributor to deforestation.</p>
<p>Question 20.<br />
What are the consequences of deforestation?<br />
Answer:<br />
The consequences of deforestation is a loss of biodiversity. Deforestation also increases greenhouse gas emissions, disrupts the water cycle, increases soil erosion and decreases the natural beauty of an area.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
What is desertification? Name one human activity which may lead to desertification.<br />
Answer:<br />
The Desertification is a land degradation in which relatively dry area of land becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water and vegetation and wildlife.</p>
<p>Agriculture, animal husbandry, and groundwater pumping/depletion, are all significant contributors to the process.</p>
<p>Question 22.<br />
Explain how, deforestation makes the soil infertile leading to desertification.<br />
Answer:<br />
Deforestation in simple term means the felling and clearing of forest cover or tree plantations to accommodate agricultural, industrial or urban use. It involves permanent end of forest cover to make that land available for residential, commercial or industrial purpose. Deforestation can also be seen as removal of forests leading to several imbalances ecologically and environmentally. What makes deforestation alarming is the immediate and long term effects it is bound to inflict if continued at the current pace. Some predictions state that the rain forests of the world will be destroyed completely if deforestation continues at its current pace.</p>
<p>Question 23.<br />
What is global warming? Name the gas responsible for causing global warming.<br />
Answer:<br />
Global Warming is the increase of Earth&#8217;s average surface temperature due to effect of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels or from deforestation, which trap heat that would otherwise escape from Earth. the gas responsible for causing global warming is carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>Question 24.<br />
How does deforestation reduce rainfall on the one hand and lead to floods on the other?<br />
Answer:<br />
When trees are cut down and there is desertification in that area so there is no transpiration and hence it result in no or minimal rainfall. When there are floods the absence of trees leads to soil erosion. It is due to the fact due to absence of trees there are no roots to hold the soil together and it gets washed away in flood.</p>
<p>Question 25.<br />
Define the term ‘biosphere’.<br />
Answer:<br />
The biosphere is the global ecological system integrating and comprising all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere.</p>
<p>Question 26.<br />
Define it:<br />
(i) biodiversity<br />
(ii) ecosystem<br />
Answer:<br />
Biodiversity &#8211; The variety of plant and animal life in the world or in a particular habitat, a high level of which is usually considered being important and desirable.</p>
<p>Ecosystem &#8211; An ecosystem is a community of living organisms with the nonliving components of their environment (things like air, water and mineral soil), interacting as a system. These biotic and abiotic components are linked through nutrient cycles and energy flows.</p>
<p>Question 27.<br />
What will happen if the natural habitat of a wild animal is destroyed?<br />
Answer:<br />
If the natural habitat of a wild animal is destroyed then the animals will run towards human habitat. There will be no space for animals and this will eventually force them to die. Plants on other hand will grow enormously and the whole life cycle and food cycle will be disturbed.</p>
<p>Question 28.<br />
What is the purpose of establishing several Biosphere Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks in India?<br />
Answer:<br />
The purpose of establishing several Biosphere Reserve, Wildlife Sanctuaries and National Parks in India is to provide protected habitat to animals birds and plants which otherwise will be captured by humans. The other purpose is also to provide ample of space to flora and fauna to survive and grow in numbers without the fear of human intervention. This also leads to conservation and development of natural forest lands.</p>
<p>Question 29.<br />
State the role of Biosphere Reserve.<br />
Answer:<br />
A biosphere reserve is an ecosystem with plants and animals of unusual scientific and natural interest.<br />
Each Biosphere Reserve should fulfill three basic functions, which are complementary and mutually reinforcing:<br />
Conservation function–to contribute to the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems, species and genetic variation;<br />
Development function–to foster economic and human development which is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable;<br />
Logistic function–to provide support for research, monitoring, education and information exchange related to local, national and global issues of conservation and development.</p>

<p>Question 47.<br />
Different between ‘endangered species’ and extinct species.<br />
Answer:<br />
An &#8220;extinct species&#8221; is a species of organism that can no longer be found in the wild or in captivity. It is already dead and can no longer be found in any part of the world.</p>
<p>The plant or animal species existing in such small numbers it is in danger of becoming extinct, especially such a species placed in jeopardy because of human activity. The specie is on the verge of extinction and have few numbers. If proper measures are not taken then it can also become extinct if proper care and measures are taken then their population can be increased.</p>
<p>Question 48.<br />
By taking the example of snakes, explain how by killing small animals, we are actually harming ourselves.<br />
Answer:<br />
The killing of small animals disturb the life cycle and food chain. For example if we kill snakes, rodents that are eaten by snakes will increase in number and destroy the crop at mass level. In another case if we kill frogs then the number of insects that destroy our crops and are eaten by frogs will damage the crop. In nutshell killing of any animal leads to our own harm.</p>
<p>Question 49.<br />

<p>Question 51.<br />
What do you understand by the term migration?<br />
Answer:<br />
Migration refers to the movement of a group of animals from one region to another, usually seasonally.</p>
<p>It is found in all major animal groups, including birds, mammals, fish, reptiles, amphibians, insects, and crustaceans. It is done by the species itself to find better and favorable habitat or by human authorities to locate animals or birds to better and safe habitat for breeding.</p>
<p>Question 52.<br />
What is meant by the migration of birds? why do birds migrate?<br />
Answer:<br />
Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. BIrds also migrate for favourable weather for their survival and breeding.</p>
<p>Question 53.<br />
What are migratory birds? Name one migratory bird which comes to warmer regions of India every year.<br />
Answer:<br />
Migratory birds are those birds that fly hundreds and thousands of kilometres to find the best ecological conditions and habitats for feeding, breeding and raising their young. When conditions at breeding sites become unfavourable, it is time to fly to regions where conditions are better.</p>
<p>The migratory bird which comes to warmer regions of India every year is Pelican.</p>
<p>Question 54.<br />
Why does Siberian crane come from Siberia to places like Bharatpur in In India every year.<br />
Answer:<br />
Siberian cranes comes to India during winter because in Siberia, it is cold, daylight is of shorter duration, food is scarce. So they look for better living conditions else where to rear their young ones and to come to India as it has favourable conditions for their survival.</p>

<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 7 Long Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 61 A.<br />
What is meant by the term ‘Wildlife’? Why should forests and wildlife be conserved?<br />
Answer:<br />
Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but includes all plants, fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.</p>
<p>We should protect forest and wildlife because Forests provide us oxygen, they cause rainfall, prevents soil erosion, Plants depend on animals and birds for their pollination and seed dispersal. Forests provide us various medicines. Various forest products are used as raw materials in industries.</p>
<p>The wild life including animal, plant and marine biodiversity keeps ecosystems functional and balanced. Healthy ecosystems allow us to survive, get enough food to eat and make a living. Biodiversity is critical to ending poverty and promoting shared prosperity for the millions who depend on nature for their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Question 61 B.<br />

To delimit the areas of their natural habitat.<br />
To protect wildlife from pollution and from natural hazards.<br />
To impose complete restriction on hunting and capturing of wildlife.<br />
To protect habitat by protecting forests.</p>
<p>Question 62 A.<br />
What are the various purposes for which the forest trees are cut?<br />
Answer:<br />
Trees are cut down for many reasons.<br />
Trees are cut to make space to build new houses and to clear land to grow crops for human consumption, grass for animals like domestic and milch animals so they can produce dairy foods. The trees are also cut down for production of paper and making of furniture. Sometimes trees are cut to make roads and buildings.</p>
<p>Question 62 B.<br />
What is effect of deforestation on wild animals?<br />
Answer:<br />
The effect of deforestation on wild animals is severe. The animals lose their natural habitat. They have to look for alternate habitat. Further due to loss of trees, the availability of food is scarce. The food chain is disturbed. In the absence of trees, if there is heavy rainfall, animals drown in flood. Due to deforestation the rains become scanty and animals die due thirst as natural water bodies dries up.</p>
<p>Question 63 A.<br />
How does deforestation cause soil erosion?<br />
Answer:<br />
Deforestation means cutting of trees. When trees are cut, the soil becomes loose. When there is heavy rainfall or flood, the soil being loose is washed away and this leads to soil erosion. This leads to flood and landsliding.</p>
<p>Question 63 B.<br />
Explain how, deforestation leads to frequent flooding of rivers.<br />
Answer:<br />
Deforestation plays several roles in the flooding equation Tree roots hold the soil in place, reducing the movement of sediment that can shrink river channels downstream. However in the absence of trees, soil is loosened, and it gets washed away easily with water or torrential rains and is deposited into river. When rivers have soil and water level more than their holding capacity, it lead to over flooding and causes floods.</p>
<p>Question 64 A.<br />
Explain how, deforestation leads to reduced rainfall.<br />
Answer:<br />
Plants need carbon dioxide for the process of photosynthesis. Fewer trees would mean that less carbon dioxide will be used up resulting in its increased amount in the atmosphere and increase in greenhouse effect. The increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall. When number of trees are reduced then less amount of water is evaporated and hence the reduced evaporation leads to reduced rainfall.</p>
<p>Question 64 B.<br />
How does deforestation lead to global warming?<br />
Answer:<br />
Deforestation leads to global warming. When trees are there, during the process of photosynthesis, the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is used and oxygen is give out. When there are more and more no trees they use more carbon dioxide and give out oxygen and bring more rainfall. However when the number of trees are few, the amount of carbon dioxide is increased. Carbon dioxide causes greenhouse effect and global warming. The reduce rainfall also increases the temperature and causes global warming.</p>
<p>Question 65.<br />
What is a Biosphere Reserve? Name any two Biosphere Reserve of India. Where are this Biosphere Reserve located?<br />

A. desalination<br />
B. desertification<br />
C. deforestation<br />
D. desegregation<br />
Answer:<br />
C. deforestation<br />
