<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>Section A Reading [20 marks]</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follows8)</strong><br />
Just a few years ago, we witnessed how a national project, the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO), which is to study fundamental particles called neutrinos, was subject to a barrage of questions from environmentalists, politicians and others ever since it was cleared. The project, which involves the construction of an underground laboratory, was initially to be located in the Nilgiris but later, on grounds that it was too close to a tiger habitat, was moved to a cavern under a rocky mountain in the Bodi West Hills region of Theni district, about 110 Kilometres West of Madurai in Tamil Nadu.<br />
The already much-delayed and important physics project needs to be explained.<br />
India has been among the pioneers in neutrino research, the first of such laboratories having been established in the 1960s. We led neutrino research when our physicists used a gold mine at Kolar in Karnataka to set-up what was then the worldâs deepest underground laboratory. This was called the Kolar Gold Field Lab. In 1965, it enabled researchers to detect atmospheric neutrinos. In 1992, when the mine became uneconomical, the laboratory was shut down. With that, we lost our advantage in understanding the most mysterious particle in the universe. INO may reclaim this advantage and our global leadership.<br />
Most of the advanced countries are already working vigorously in neutrino science with dedicated labs. These include the United States, Russia, France, Italy, China, Japan and South Korea. India is set to not only join this league, but also become a key player in global efforts in neutrino science. The Magnetised Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) being set-up at INO will be among the largest ever in the world, weighing over 50000 tonnes.<br />
Neutrinos, first proposed by Swiss Scientist Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, are the second most widely occurring particle in the universe, only second to photons, the particle which makes up light. In fact, neutrinos are so abundant among us that every second, there are more than 100 trillion of them passing right through each of us &#8211; we never even notice them.<br />
This is the reason why INO needs to be built deep into the Earth â 1300 metres into the Earth. At this depth, it would be able to keep itself away from all the trillions of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere and which would otherwise choke an over-the-ground neutrino detector. Neutrinos have been in the universe literally since forever, being almost 14 billion years old â as much as the universe itself.<br />
From experiments so far, we know that neutrinos have a tiny mass, but the ordering of the neutrino mass states is not known and is one of the key questions that remain unanswered till today. This is a major challenge INO will set to resolve, thus completing our picture of the neutrino.<br />
Neutrinos are very important for our scientific progress and technological growth for three reasons. First, they are abundant. Second, they have very feeble mass and no charge and hence can travel through planets, stars, rocks and human bodies without any interaction. In fact, a beam of trillions of neutrinos can travel thousands of kilometres through a rock before an interaction with a single atom of the rock and the neutrino occurs. Third, they hide within them a vast pool of knowledge and could open up new vistas in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, communication and even in medical imaging, through the detector spin-offs.<br />
While this should be a moment of joy, there is also some scepticism, partly arising due to the fact that the neutrino, though so abundant, is a silent stranger to most people.<br />
<strong>(a) On the basis of your reading of the above passage, make notes on it using</strong><br />
<strong> headings and subheadings. Use recognisable abbreviations wherever necessary (minimum 4). Supply an appropriate title to it. (5)</strong><br />
<strong> (b) Write a summary of the above passage in about 80-100 words. (3)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the guestions that follow. (12)</strong></p>
<p>A pacifist at heart and an inventor by nature, Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. He was sure his creation would help bring about the end of war. â When two armies of equal strength can annihilate each other in an instantâ, he once wrote, âthen all civilised nations will retreat and disband their troopsâ. Things didnât quite go according to plan. ,<br />
The invention that he thought would end all wars was seen by many others as an extremely deadly product. In 1888, when Alfredâs brother Ludvig died, a French newspaper mistakenly ran an obituary for Alfred which called him the âmerchant of deathâ. Not wanting to go down in history with such a horrible epitaph, Nobel created a will that soon shocked his relatives and established the now famous Nobel prizes.<br />
According to his will, Alfred Nobelâs enormous fortune was to be used to establish prizes to award those who had done their best to benefit mankind in the field of physics,chemistry, medicine, literature and peace. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901, five years after Nobelâs death. Nobel initially donated 35 million Swedish Kronor (about $225 million today); the prizes come from the fortuneâs annual interest.<br />
The Nobel Laureates are announced at the beginning of October each year. A couple of months later, on 10th December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobelâs death, they receive their prize from the Swedish King &#8211; a Nobel Diploma, a medal and 10 million Swedish crowns per prize. All Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which is awarded in Oslo, Norway.<br />
Each award is decided by separate institutions which form assemblies to select the actual prize recipients. Some prizes (medicine) require Nobel assembly members to remain active in their fields, while others (literature) appoint members for life. The Peace prize is actually decided by five members of the Norwegian Parliament. Nobel Prize winners must be living; there are no posthumous awards. Each year, the Nobel committees distribute nomination forms to an undisclosed number of recipients &#8211; past winners, prominent institutions, respected members of the field &#8211; who are allowed to choose as many nominees as they want. Self-nomination is not permitted. The winner is decided by a simple majority vote.<br />

<p><strong>1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions that follows8)</strong><br />
Just a few years ago, we witnessed how a national project, the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO), which is to study fundamental particles called neutrinos, was subject to a barrage of questions from environmentalists, politicians and others ever since it was cleared. The project, which involves the construction of an underground laboratory, was initially to be located in the Nilgiris but later, on grounds that it was too close to a tiger habitat, was moved to a cavern under a rocky mountain in the Bodi West Hills region of Theni district, about 110 Kilometres West of Madurai in Tamil Nadu.<br />
The already much-delayed and important physics project needs to be explained.<br />
India has been among the pioneers in neutrino research, the first of such laboratories having been established in the 1960s. We led neutrino research when our physicists used a gold mine at Kolar in Karnataka to set-up what was then the worldâs deepest underground laboratory. This was called the Kolar Gold Field Lab. In 1965, it enabled researchers to detect atmospheric neutrinos. In 1992, when the mine became uneconomical, the laboratory was shut down. With that, we lost our advantage inÂ understanding the most mysterious particle in the universe. INO may reclaim this advantage and our global leadership.<br />
Most of the advanced countries are already working vigorously in neutrino science with dedicated labs. These include the United States, Russia, France, Italy, China, Japan and South Korea. India is set to not only join this league, but also become a key player in global efforts in neutrino science. The Magnetised Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) being set-up at INO will be among the largest ever in the world, weighing over 50000 tonnes.<br />
Neutrinos, first proposed by Swiss Scientist Wolfgang Pauli in 1930, are the second most widely occurring particle in the universe, only second to photons, the particle which makes up light. In fact, neutrinos are so abundant among us that every second, there are more than 100 trillion of them passing right through each of us &#8211; we never even notice them.<br />
This is the reason why INO needs to be built deep into the Earth â 1300 metres into the Earth. At this depth, it would be able to keep itself away from all the trillions of neutrinos produced in the atmosphere and which would otherwise choke an over-the-ground neutrino detector. Neutrinos have been in the universe literally since forever, being almost 14 billion years old â as much as the universe itself.<br />
From experiments so far, we know that neutrinos have a tiny mass, but the ordering of the neutrino mass states is not known and is one of the key questions that remain unanswered till today. This is a major challenge INO will set to resolve, thus completing our picture of the neutrino.<br />
Neutrinos are very important for our scientific progress and technological growth for three reasons. First, they are abundant. Second, they have very feeble mass and no charge and hence can travel through planets, stars, rocks and human bodies without any interaction. In fact, a beam of trillions of neutrinos can travel thousands of kilometres through a rock before an interaction with a single atom of the rock and the neutrino occurs. Third, they hide within them a vast pool of knowledge and could open up new vistas in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, communication and even in medical imaging, through the detector spin-offs.<br />
While this should be a moment of joy, there is also some scepticism, partly arising due to the fact that the neutrino, though so abundant, is a silent stranger to most people.<br />

<strong>(b) Summary</strong><br />
India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) was subject to questions from many groups. It involves construction of an underground laboratory, which was supposed to be located in Nilgiris, but was later moved to Bodi West Hills in Tamil Nadu. India had been among the pioneers in neutrino research and its first lab was set-up in 1960, in Kolar, but was shut down in 1992. Understanding neutrinos has become essential for its wide occurrence. It has been found to have tiny mass with unknown order. It is important for scientific progress and technological growth.</p>
<p><strong>2. Read the following passage carefully and answer the guestions that follow. (12) </strong><br />
A pacifist at heart and an inventor by nature, Swedish chemist Alfred Nobel invented dynamite. He was sure his creation would help bring about the end of war. â When two armies of equal strength can annihilate each other in an instantâ, he once wrote, âthen all civilised nations will retreat and disband their troopsâ. Things didnât quite go according to plan. ,<br />
The invention that he thought would end all wars was seen by many others as an extremely deadly product. In 1888, when Alfredâs brother Ludvig died, a French newspaper mistakenly ran an obituary for Alfred which called him the âmerchant of deathâ. Not wanting to go down in history with such a horrible epitaph, Nobel created a will that soon shocked his relatives and established the now famous Nobel prizes.<br />
According to his will, Alfred Nobelâs enormous fortune was to be used to establish prizes to award those who had done their best to benefit mankind in the field of physics,chemistry, medicine, literature and peace. The first Nobel Prizes were awarded in 1901, five years after Nobelâs death. Nobel initially donated 35 million Swedish Kronor (about $225 million today); the prizes come from the fortuneâs annual interest.<br />
The Nobel Laureates are announced at the beginning of October each year. A couple of months later, on 10th December, the anniversary of Alfred Nobelâs death, they receive their prize from the Swedish King &#8211; a Nobel Diploma, a medal and 10 million Swedish crowns per prize. All Nobel prizes are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden, except for the Nobel Peace Prize which is awarded in Oslo, Norway.<br />
Each award is decided by separate institutions which form assemblies to select the actual prize recipients. Some prizes (medicine) require Nobel assembly members to remain active in their fields, while others (literature) appoint members for life. The Peace prize is actually decided by five members of the Norwegian Parliament. Nobel Prize winners must be living; there are no posthumous awards. Each year, the Nobel committees distribute nomination forms to an undisclosed number of recipients &#8211; past winners, prominent institutions, respected members of the field &#8211; who are allowed to choose as many nominees as they want. Self-nomination is not permitted. The winner is decided by a simple majority vote.<br />

Sir,<br />
There are dangers of using headphones especially, while crossing roads and railway tracks. To keep themselves entertained at all times, people are seen using headphones constantly. DoingÂ so, particularly while crossing roads or railway tracks can prove dangerous as they would be deaf to the sound of a horn or any kind of emergency signal. We witness so many unwanted accidents occurring daily because of this practice.<br />
People should be asked to avoid headphone use at both of these places. Awareness should be spread through hoardings, posters and newspaper advertisements. A minimum fine should be imposed on people found using headphones while crossing railway tracks. It might upset the public at first, but would prove beneficial in the long run .<br />

<p style="text-align: center;">by Khushboo Gupta</p>
<p>Senior citizens have a tale of sorrow to tell. They spent all their lives struggling to provide their children with the best facilities, without looking for their own comforts. But what happens in old age? Their kids gets settled, move on with their lives, abandoning the elders to the mercy of God.<br />
Most of these elders are forced to take shelter in old age homes distant from their house. Instead of love and care of their children and grandchildren they get monthly allowances. Also in our country there is no retirement age or benefits for all citizens, which aggravates the problem of those who cannot afford old age homes.<br />
Senior citizens should be encouraged to join as volunteers in social and philanthropic activities like-social work in slums, child care etc. This will ensure self dependence for them. Every government and private hospital should have a geriatric ward where long-term care can be given to the elderly suffering from age-related diseases which cannot be treated at home.<br />
Every year we observe the International Senior Citizens Day by holding seminars, walks and meetings. This is not enough. We must do something concrete which would have long and lasting benefits.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Vijender Singh Live</strong></p>
<p>Vijender Singh, the famous Indian boxer is one of my favourite sportspersons. I admire his dedicated hard work. Yesterday, I grabbed the opportunity to see him perform live at the Commonwealth Games. The stadium was jam-packed with fans from across the nation. It was a match against Englandâs Frank Buglioni.<br />
As soon as Vijender entered, the whole stadium applauded with enthusiasm. Even the opponentâs team was amazed to hear the loud applause. Vijender entered very confidently, waving to the crowd, havingÂ the Indian flag on his shoulders. Audienceâs enthusiasm boosted his confidence. He went to the ring and gave a welcoming glance to his opponent.<br />
As soon as the fight started, Vijender seemed prepared for any eventuality. He was composed in his moves and was not scared of the opponentâs actions. Both the players gave their all to the bout. My eyes were glued to the moves and calm attitude this Indian player had. At last, Vijender defeated frank 13-3. The stadium was filled with joy. He again became an inspiration to many including me. Later, the award ceremony was an experience in itself, which made every Indian proud.</p>

<p><strong>9. Read the extract and answer the following questions.(1&#215;3 = 3)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>âWhen did my childhood go?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Was it when I found my mind was really mine,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>To use whichever way I choose,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Producing thoughts that were not those of other people</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>But my own, and mine alone</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Was that the day!â</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>(a) What does the poet say here?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>(b) When does he think he lost his childhood?</strong></p>
<p><strong>(c) Does he find an answer to his question?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Â </strong>(i) The poet here wonders whether he lost his childhood when he became rational and mature.<br />
(ii) He thinks that he lost his childhood when his thoughts were his own to command and he couldÂ take independent decisions.<br />
(iii) The poet finds a partial answer to his question. He might have lost his childhood, then as he exclaims in the last line of the stanza.</p>
<p><strong>10. Answer any three of the following questions.(3&#215;3 = 9)</strong><br />
<strong>(i) Does the poet like how the adults behave? Discuss with reference to the poem, &#8216;Childhood&#8217;.</strong><br />
<strong>(ii) How does the poem &#8216;Father to Son&#8217; talk of a universal experience of relationships?</strong><br />
<strong>(iii) Why was Aram not ready to return the horse?</strong><br />
<strong>(iv) What did Mrs S think about Mrs Dorling?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Â </strong>(i) No, the poet doesnât like how the adults behave. He says that adults are manipulative and<br />
hypocrites. They talk and preach of love but don&#8217;t act lovingly. He is lamenting their behaviour. He searches for his childhood and finds it hidden in an infantâs face.<br />
(ii) The poem âFather to Sonâ describes the relationship between a father and a son. However, its appeal is fairly universal. What happens in the poem, happens to most fathers and sons. It is quite common in families. The generation gap has remained as it is. Moreover, the structure of society is such that a father expects his son to follow his wishes, leading to individuality clashes.<br />
(iii) Like his cousin Mourad, Aram was fond of horseriding. When Mourad stole a beautiful white horse, Aram didnât consider it as stealing. Rather he himself wanted to learn horse riding like Mourad. He also had a great passion for it. So, he wanted to keep the horse with himself until he would become a perfect horse rider.<br />
(iv) Mrs Dorling was an old acquaintance of Mrs S. They had revived their contacts recently. Mrs S trusted her completely and to her she was a very nice lady. Mrs Dorling offered help to Mrs S in the time of war and hence she had high respect for her. She held her in high esteem and believed in her selflessness.</p>

How are you? I hope that you are doing much better than me.<br />
Here, school education is just unproductive. The teachers believe that learning facts is education.<br />
They don&#8217;t wish to use innovative ideas to make their subject interesting. I&#8217;m not criticising all<br />
the teachers of my school. In fact, my mathematics teacher, Mr Koch, is quite different from theÂ rest. He understands our problems and always tries to solve them.<br />
In contrast, my history teacher, Mr Broun, punished me just because I could not tell the year when Prussia defeated France. His approach is quite primitive. The thing I hate the most is that they discourage new thoughts of the students. When I told that I don&#8217;t feel that learning these dates would be of much importance, he insulted me.<br />
I hope to get out of this hateful school as soon an possible.<br />
Yours truly,<br />
Albert.</p>

<p>The problem faced by mothers in the story, âMothers Day&#8217; is a universal problem. In my family, my mother gets up early in the morning to prepare our breakfasts and lunches. If there is a delay of even of a minute on her part, we all bring the roof down.<br />
The same ritual takes place in the evening as well. Mother goes to bed after everyone else. We have all taken her presence for granted. One day, my grandmother fell sick and mother had to go away for two days. Without her, the entire house was a mess. We all waited for her as if we were waiting for some miracle to happen. When, finally, she came back, we all heaved a sigh of relief and vowed never to take her lightly.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>12. Given a brief description of the funeral ceremony of Sir Simon&#8217;s ghost.</strong></p>
<p><strong>(The Canterville Ghost) Â  Â (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or</strong><br />
<strong>WTiy was Booker concerned about the students of his school during winter? (Up From Slavery) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Â </strong>After the encounter of Sir Simon&#8217;s ghost with Virginia, the ghost underwent a transformation and repented for his sins. It was his gratitude and repentance which earned him a stately funeral to ensure peace for his soul after death.<br />
The funeral was arranged at the Canterville Chase. It was eleven oâclock at night when the funeral carriage was carried by eight black horses. The leaden coffin was covered with the Canterville coat of arms. The ceremony was attended by all the members of the Otis family. Lord Canterville and Mrs Umney. The coffin was buried under the old yew tree, in the Garden of Death. Virginia paid homage to the memory of Sir Simon by placing a cross with white and pink almond flowers on the coffin. As she stood silently, the soft moonbeams created a divine ambience and a little bird began to sing sweetly.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or Â  Â </strong></p>
<p>With the opening of the boarding department students began coming in still larger numbers. For weeks they had to contend with the drTcu&#8217;ty of providing sleeping accommodation-with no money. For this, they rented a number uaoins near the school. These cabins were in a dilapidated condition and during the winter months the students who occupied them necessarily suffered from the cold.<br />
The weather during the second winter was awfully cold. They were not able to provide enough bed clothes to keep the students warm. During the coldest nights the discomfort of the students was pitiable. Often they spent a sleepless night sitting huddled around a fire, with only one blanket.<br />
Despite this, there were no complaints because they knew this was the best that the institute could afford. Booker was so troubled about the discomfort of the students that he could not sleep himself.<br />
<strong>13. Give a character sketch of the Canterville Ghost. (The Canterville Ghost) (6)</strong><br />
<strong>or Â Â </strong><br />
<strong>Write a few lines about Booker T. Washington. (Up From Slavery) Â  Â (6)</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.Â </strong>The Canterville Ghost is the most colourful character in the novel. Sir Simon de Canterville is the ghost that has lived in the Canterville Chase since 1584.<br />
Sir Simon had murdered his wife Lady Eleanore de Canterville in Canterville chase, in 1575. Sir Simon had lived for nine years after this incident. His body was not found after his death.<br />
Throughout the story, the ghost appears to be very depressed. His failure to fight the members of the Otis family make him frustrated. It is only at the end that he meets Virginia, the girl of the Otis family. She takes the ghost seriously and helps him achieve solvation through her prayers. Virginia trusts him and at last the funeral ceremony of the ghost leaves a sentimental message to the story.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>or</strong></p>
<p>Bookerâs earliest impressions were of the plantation and the slave quarters, the most miserable desolate and discouraging of surroundings. He began working at a very young age. He pulled himself out of the institution of slavery and was determined to pull his people up with him. He took every opportunity to propagate his ideas and philosophies to all races so that attitudes would change in America. Atrocities, constant struggle and failure never deterred his spirits.<br />
He saw many terrible things happen to his people, but remained optimistic that, with education and hard work, they could effectively blend with white society. He devoted his life to his students and his race and was loved and respected by them. He instilled in them the dignity of manual labour. He was a good orator and in his speeches he always demanded justice for the coloured race.</p>
