<strong> ‘Despite the exclusiveness of the white cricket elite in the West Indies, the game became hugely popular in the Caribbean’. Explain.</strong><br />

While men were expected to be serious, strong, independent and aggressive, women were seen as frivolous, delicate, passive and docile.<br />
(ii)From childhood, girls were tightly laced up and dressed in stays. The effort was to restrict the growth of their bodies, contain them within small moulds. When slightly older, girls had to wear tight fitting corsets.<br />
(iii)Tightly laced, small-waisted women were admired as attractive, elegant and graceful. Clothing thus played a part in creating the image of frail, submissive Victorian women.<br />

The sandy soils of the desert support cactus and thorny bushes while wet, marshy deltic soils support mangroves and deltic vegetation.<br />
(ii)<strong>Different climatic conditions</strong> : Different climatic conditions prevail in India. At some places, the temperature is at 55°C and at other, it is about &#8211; 45°C. So it supports all types of plants. Some places receive a rainfall of more than 1000 cm, and some receive only 50 cm. This also helps in growing different types of plants.<br />
(iii)<strong>Sunlight</strong> : Sunlight is one of the important factors responsible for the growth of vegetation. Due to the longer duration of sunlight, trees grow faster in most parts of India.</p>

<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Why did the British insist on growing opium in India ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> (i) Need for sleepers : With the expansion of Railways large number of sleepers were required. To fulfil the demand of sleepers, trees were felled on a massive scale.<br />
(ii) Fuel: To run locomotives, wood was needed as fuel. As railway was expanding, the demand for fuel also became very high.<br />
(iii)Cutting of trees for railway tracks : Upto 1946, the length of the tracks had increased to over 765,000 km. As the railway tracks spread through India, a larger and larger number of trees were felled. Even the forests around the railway tracks started disappearing.<br />
(iv)Forest became accessible : With the introduction of railway the forest became accessible.<br />
(v) Private contractors : With the introduction of railways the demand for wood rose dramatically. To meet the demand government gave out contracts to individuals who began cutting trees indiscriminately.<br />
Or<br />
(i)Through these Acts, some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like deodar or sal were declared ‘Reserved’. No pastoralist was allowed an access to these forests.<br />
(ii)These Forest Acts changed the lives of the pastoralists. They were now prevented from entering many forests that had earlier provided valuable forage for their cattle.<br />
(iii)Even in the areas they were allowed entry, their movements were regulated. They needed a permit for entry. The timing of their entry and departure was specified and the number of days they could spend in the forest, was limited.<br />
(iv)Pastoralists could no longer remain in an area even if the forage was available, the grass was succulent and the undergrowth in the forest was ample. They had to move because the Forest Department permits that had been issued to them now ruled their lives.<br />
(v)The permit specified the periods in which they could be legally within a forest. If they overstayed, they were liable to fines.<br />
Or<br />
(i) In the late 18th century, the English East India Company was buying tea and silk from China for sale in England.<br />
(ii)As tea was gaining popularity in England, its demand rose from 15 million pounds to 30 million pounds.<br />
(iii)England at that time produced nothing that could be easily sold in China.<br />
(iv)This means an outflow of treasure from England to China.<br />
(v)Merchants wanted to balance their trade.<br />
(vi)So they searched for a commodity they could sell in China.<br />
(vii)Opium was such a commodity which had a demand in China, as it was used in medicines.<br />
(viii)So to balance their trade and to earn huge profits, they persuaded Indian farmers to grow opium so that the British traders could sell it in China.</p>
<p><strong>22.Which was the first Indian community to play cricket in India ? Explain the contribution of the community in spreading cricket in India.</strong><br />
<strong> Or</strong><br />
<strong> Why did Mahatma Gandhi’s dream of clothing the nation in Khadi became an appeal only to some sections of Indians ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. The Parsis, a small community of the Zoroastrians, was the first Indian community to start playing cricket. They founded the first Indian cricket club, known as the Oriental Cricket Club in Bombay (Mumbai) in 1848. The chief causes for the same were the following :<br />
(i)They came into a close contact with the British because of their interest in trade.<br />
(ii)They were the first Indian community to westernise and learn English language and literature.<br />
(iii)They built their own Gymkhana to play cricket.<br />
(iv)A Parsi cricket team beat the British cricket team in 1889. This triumph filled their heart and soul with pride.<br />
(v) The Parsis thus became the pioneers of Indian cricket. Their example encouraged other Indians to establish their own clubs.<br />
Or<br />
Mahatma Gandhi’s dream was to clothe the whole nation in khadi. Though he succeeded using khadi as a source to inspire the Indian people but there were many with different opinions.<br />
(i)The British machines made clothes which were much cheaper as compared to khadi. Poverty rate was very high in India, so most of the poor started adopting foreign clothes.<br />
(ii)The wealthy Parsis of western India were among the first to adapt Western-style clothing because western clothes were a sign of modernity and progress.<br />
(iii)Though Motilal Nehru gave up his expensive Western-style suits and adopted the Indian dhoti and kurta but these were not made up of coarse material as suggested by Gandhiji.<br />
(iv)As the caste system in India was very rigid and the western dress style was for all, so many people adopted it for self-respect and equality</p>
