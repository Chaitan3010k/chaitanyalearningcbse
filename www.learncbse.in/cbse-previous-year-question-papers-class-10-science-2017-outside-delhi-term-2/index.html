<p>Question 9.<br />
Write the number of periods and groups in the Modem Periodic Table. How does the metallic character of elements vary on moving<br />
(i) from left to right in a period, and<br />
(ii) down a group ? Give reason to justify your answer. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
In the modem periodic table, there are 18 vertical columns known as Groups and 7 horizontal rows known as Periods.<br />
Metallic character: It is defined as the tendency of an atom to lose electrons.<br />
(i) Across the period i.e., from left to right, metallic character decreases.<br />
(ii) Down the group i.e., from top to bottom, metallic character increases.<br />
Reason: Across the period, the effective nuclear charge increases, thus decreasing its atomic radius. This favours the electronegativity and therefore the tendency &#8216; to lose electrons is low. This accounts for the decrease in the metallic character. As we move down the group, the number of shells keep on increasing and therefore the atomic size increases and electronegativity decreases. This enhances the ability to lose electrons and therefore the metallic character increases.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Na, Mg and Al are the elements of the 3rd period of the Modern Periodic Table having group number 1, 2 and 13 respectively. Which one of these elements has the (a) highest valency, (b) largest atomic radius, and (c) maximum chemical reactivity ? Justify your answer stating the reason for each. [3]<br />

Magnesium (Mg), At. number 12, 2, 8, 2<br />
Aluminium (Al), At. number 13, 2, 8, 3<br />
(a) The element having the highest valency is Al, as it has 3 valence electrons.<br />
(b) The element with the largest atomic radius is Na as left to right atomic radius decreases.<br />
(c) The element with maximum chemical reactivity is Na as metallic character decreases left to right.</p>
<p>Question 11.<br />
Reproduction is one of the most important characteristics of living beings. Give three reasons in support of the statement. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Reproduction is an energy-consuming process which is not essential for the survival of an individual. But it is highly essential for all the living beings because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduction helps in increasing the number of members of a population.</li>
<li>By replacing the dead members with the new ones, it minimizes the risk of extinction of a species.</li>
<li>It brings about variations in species, thus, leading to their evolution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 12.<br />
What is vegetative propagation ? State two advantages and two disadvantages of this method. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Vegetative propagation is a mode of asexual reproduction in which new plants are obtained from vegetative parts of the plants such as shoots or stem for the propagation of new plants.<br />
Two advantages of vegetative propagation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plants which do not produce seeds are propagated by this method.</li>
<li>Vegetative propagation is a cheaper, easier and rapid method of propagation in plants than growing plants from their seeds. Plants grow very slowly and take 4 to 7 years to develop flowers when grown with their seeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two disadvantages of vegetative propagation are:</p>
<ul>
<li>As there is no genetic variation, there is no chance of development of new and better varieties.</li>
<li>The vegetatively propagated plants are more prone to diseases that are specific to the species.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 13.<br />
List three techniques that have been developed to prevent pregnancy. Which one of these techniques is not meant for males ? How does the use of these techniques have a direct impact on the health and prosperity of a family? [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Three techniques that have been developed to prevent pregnancy are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mechanical Methods: Include condoms, diaphragm, IUCDs, etc.</li>
<li>Chemical Methods : Include oral contraceptive pills, spermicide.</li>
<li>Surgical Method: Includes vasectomy and tubectomy.<br />
The chemical methods are not meant for males.</li>
</ol>
<p>The use of such contraceptive methods have various benefits, such as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Large size of families have a negative impact on the economic status of the family.</li>
<li>Having pregnancies at quick successions reduces mother&#8217;s health and vitality. Use of contraceptive devices thus, effects the maternal health status.</li>
<li>Some contraceptive devices (such as condoms) are also helpful in preventing sexually transmitted diseases.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 14.<br />
How did Mendel explain.that it is possible that a trait is inherited but not expressed in an organism? [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Some traits that are inherited may not express themselves. Such hidden traits are known as recessive traits. Mendel explained this phenomenon with the help of monohybrid cross. In a monohybrid cross performed by Mendel, tall plant was crossed with a dwarf plant which produced all tall plants in F<sub>1</sub> progeny.<br />
However, when these F<sub>1</sub> tall plants were crossed with each other, both tall and dwarf pea plants were obtained in F<sub>2</sub> generation. Reappearance of the dwarf pea plants in F<sub>2</sub> generation proves that the dwarf trait was inherited but not expressed in F<sub>1 </sub>generation.<br />

So, dwarfness traits of plants (pea plant) were not lost but are suppressed in the F<sub>1</sub> generation and thus reappears in F<sub>2</sub> generation.</p>
<p>Question 15.<br />
“Evolution and classification of organisms are interlinked&#8221;. Give reasons to justify this statement. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Classification refers to the grouping and naming of organisms based on the similarities and difference in their characters. Classification is done on the basis of ancestral characteristics and derived characteristics. So as we move from simple life forms to the complex organisms, we are actually tracing the path of evolution. All life forms on earth have progressively changed during evolution. So the hierarchy develops during classification which throws the light on the evolutionary relationship among organisms. Common ancestors can also be predicted with the help of classification.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />

<p>Question 17.<br />
State the cause of dispersion of white light by a glass prism. How did Newton, using two identical glass prisms show that white light is made of seven colours ? Draw a ray diagram to show the path of a narrow beam of white light, through a combination of two identical prisms arranged together in inverted position with respect to each other, when it is allowed to fall obliquely on one of the faces of the first prism of the combination. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
When a beam of white light enters a prism, it gets refracted at point and splits into its seven constituent colours. This splitting of the white light occurs because of different angles of bending for each colour and this different angles of bending occurs because different components of light have different refractive indices when passing through the glass prism.</p>
<p>Firstly, Newton made white light to fall on a prism, this cause dispersion of white light into seven colours. Newton then placed an inverted prism in the path of a colour band of seven colours. Only a beam of white &#8216; light comes out from the second prism. So, Newton concluded that white light comprises of seven component colours.<br />

<p>Question 18.<br />
(a) Water is an elixir of life, a very important natural resource. Your science teacher wants you to prepare a plan for a formative assessment activity, &#8220;How to save water, the vital natural resource&#8221;. Write any two ways that you will suggest to bring awareness in your neighbourhood, on how to save water.<br />
(b) Name and explain any one way by which the underground water table does not go down further. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Water is one of the most precious natural resources that has varied importance in our lives. It is an essential component of the human body, and is used almost everywhere in our day to day activities such as cooking, washing, farming etc. It is an indispensable part of our lives, without which life on earth is not possible. However, the amount of freshwater available for sustaining life is very less, so it is very important to save water by the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning off the taps during brushing, washing clothes/utensils etc., and use of buckets instead of showers for bathing.</li>
<li>Reusing of water by storing water after washing fruits and vegetables for watering plants and cleaning cars.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) The underground water table can be recharged through rainwater harvesting. Rainwater harvesting is a process by which rain water is collected and stored for the purpose of recharging the ground water or for future use like for irrigation and agriculture. In India, rainwater harvesting is an old tradition which is followed till now in many parts of India. For example, bawris are traditional architectual rainwater harvesters that were built for collecting water in the state of Rajasthan.<br />
There are two ways of rainwater harvesting:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface run off harvesting: In urban areas, rainwater that flows away from the surface can be collected and used for various purposes.</li>
<li>Rooftop rainwater harvesting: The rainwater on the roofs of the buildings is collected through canals that drains the water into ground reservoirs. This stored water is later utilised.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 19.<br />
Why are certain compounds called hydrocarbons? Write the general formula for homologous series of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes and also draw the structure of the first member of each series. Write the name of the reaction that converts alkenes into alkanes and also write a chemical equation to show the necessary conditions for the reaction to occur. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
Compounds consisting of carbon and hydrogen are known as hydrocarbons.<br />
1. Saturated hydrocarbons: Alkanes (C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>) are the compounds of carbon which have single bond.<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48379022442_ffee3d2a58_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2017 Outside Delhi Term 2 Set I Q19" width="95" height="90" /><br />
2. Unsaturated hydrocarbons: The compounds of carbon having double bonds are alkene (C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>) and those having triple bonds are alkyne (C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-2</sub>).<br />
The reaction which converts unsaturated hydrocarbons to saturated hydrocarbons i.e., alkenes to alkane is known as hydrogenation reaction. It is used to obtain ghee from oil.<br />

<p>Question 20.<br />
(a) Write the functions of each of the following parts in a human female reproductive system:<br />
(i) Ovary<br />
(ii) Uterus<br />
(iii) Fallopian tube<br />
(b) Write the structure and functions of the placenta in a human female. [5]<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) (i) Functions of the Ovary:</p>
<ul>
<li>It produces female gametes (ova).</li>
<li>It secretes female sex hormones</li>
</ul>
<p>(ii) Functions of Uterus:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports and nourishes the developing foetus.</li>
<li>It expands according to the growth of the baby.</li>
</ul>
<p>(iii) Functions of Fallopian tubes:</p>
<ul>
<li>They carry eggs from the ovary to the uterus.</li>
<li>They act as the site for fertilisation.</li>
</ul>
<p>(b) The placenta is the connecting link between the mother&#8217;s body and the baby. It is a disc embedded in the uterine wall. This special tissue contains villi on the embryo&#8217;s side of the tissue. The mother&#8217;s end of the placenta has blood spaces, which surrounds the villi. Placenta functions as a site of exchange of materials between the blood of the mother to the baby. The developing embryo generates certain waste substances that are also removed through placenta. Thus, the placenta serves as the nutritive, respiratory and excretory organ of the foetus.</p>
<p>Question 21.<br />
With the help of one example for each, distinguish between the acquired traits and the inherited traits. Why are the traits/ experiences acquired during the entire lifetime of an individual not inherited in the next generation? Explain the reason for this fact with an example. [5]<br />

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Traits can be passed on to the next generation only when they have some direct effect on the genes. The traits acquired during the lifetime of an individual cannot be inherited as they do not affect the genetic makeup of an organism. In fact, these traits develop due to the use and disuse of organs or due to the direct effect of the environment. Thus, they are not passed on to the next generation. For example, a wrestler develops large muscles because of his training programme, it does not mean that his offspring will necessarily have large muscles. Similarly, if a lady pierces her nose, the children produced to her will not have pierced nose by birth.</p>

The ray diagram is shown below:<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48379022392_fe61bd1a60_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2017 Outside Delhi Term 2 Set I Q23" width="297" height="189" /><br />
Use of convex mirror: Convex mirror is used as rearview mirror in vehicles as it always produces a virtual, erect and diminished image of an object. So, images of vehicles over a wide area can be seen easily in it.<br />
(b) Radius of curvature: The distance between the centre of curvature and pole of a spherical mirror is called radius of curvature.<br />
R = +24 cm<br />
f = \(\frac { R }{ 2 }\) = \(\frac { 24 }{ 2 }\) = +12 cm<br />
The mirror is convex mirror.</p>

<p>Question 2.<br />
Newly formed DNA copies may not be identical at times. Give one reason. [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
During the process of replication of DNA, most of the base sequences in the new copies are identical to those in the parent DNA. However, some changes can occur either due to mutation or due to minor errors during the replication process. Thus, the newly formed DNA copies may not be identical at times.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
In the following food chain, plants provide 500 J of energy to rats. How much energy will be available to hawks from snakes?<br />
Plants → Rats → Snakes → Hawks [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
500 J of energy is available to the rats thus according to 10% law, 50 J energy will be available to snakes and 5 J energy will be available to hawk.</p>
<p>Question 4.<br />
An object is placed at a distance of 15 cm from a convex lens of focal length 20 cm. List four characteristics (nature, position, etc.) of the image formed by the lens. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
Given, u = -15 cm, f = 20 cm<br />
\(\frac { 1 }{ f }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) &#8211; \(\frac { 1 }{ u }\)<br />
\(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) + \(\frac { 1 }{ 15 }\)<br />
\(\frac { 1 }{ v }\) = \(\frac { 1 }{ 20 }\) &#8211; \(\frac { 1 }{ 15 }\)<br />
v = -60 cm<br />
Four characteristics of the image formed by the lens are:</p>
<ul>

<li>At a distance of 60 cm on the same side of the lens as the object</li>
<li>Enlarged or magnified image.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
Why is an equitable distribution of resources essential in a society? List two forces which are against such distribution. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
Equitable distribution of resources is when every individual gets an equal right to access all the available resources and is benefited directly or indirectly. It also avoids the division of society to an extent.<br />
The main forces which work against equitable distribution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of natural resources.</li>
<li>Excessive consumption by the rich.</li>
<li>Profit motive of people exploiting resources.</li>
<li>Corruption. (Any two)</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Why must we conserve our forests? List two factors responsible for causing deforestation. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
We must conserve forests because we derive countless benefits such as food, timber etc. from them and they are an important component of our ecosystem. Factors that contribute to deforestation are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Large scale development projects have contributed to the loss of forests.</li>
<li>Forests are cleared on a large scale to meet the growing needs of industrialisation, especially fuelwood and for other forest products and minerals.</li>
<li>Mining has also contributed to deforestation.</li>
<li>With the increase in population and growing demand for commercial crops and the need for more and more land for agriculture, has to lead to deforestation.</li>
<li>Growing urbanisation, trees are cut to establish cities, to lay down infrastructure.</li>
</ol>

<p>Question 10.<br />
Explain esterification reaction with the help of a chemical equation. Describe an activity to show esterification. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The reaction of carboxylic acid with alcohol forms an ester. This process of formation of ester is called esterification.<br />
CH<sub>3</sub>COOH + CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH → CH<sub>3</sub>COOCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<br />
Activity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take 1 ml of ethanol and 1 ml of glacial acetic acid in a boiling tube and mix the contents well.</li>
<li>Add few drops of conc. H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> to it.</li>
<li>Warm the contents on a water bath for a few minutes.</li>
<li>Now pour the solution in a beaker containing 20-50 mL of water.</li>
<li>A sweet fruity smell indicating the formation of an ester is observed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 11.<br />
With the help of two suitable examples, explain why certain experiences and traits earned by people during their lifetime are not passed on to their next generations. When can such traits be passed on? [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The experiences and qualifications that a person earns during their lifetime are examples of acquired traits. These traits are not inherited, they do riot affect the genetic makeup. They are developed due to the direct affect of the environment. Thus they are not passed to the next generation. Piercing of ears or large sized muscles of the wrestler are not carried by the next generation. Traits can only be passed on to the next generation only when they have some direct effect on the genes. For example, mutation is caused in the germ cells of a person due to exposure to some harmful radiations, it is likely that the mutation will be passed on to the subsequent generations.</p>
<p>Question 14.<br />
Describe reproduction by spores in Rhizopus. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Rhizopus is a fungus that reproduces by spore formation. The fungal hyphae gives rise to a globular structure known as sporangium. The sporangium gives rise to several spores by repetitive division of its nucleus. Each nucleus gets surrounded by a part of cytoplasm and thus develops into a spore. These spores then mature inside the sporangium. Once they are fully mature, the sporangium bursts to release these spores in the environment. Since the spores disperse through air, they can land on various sites. These sites may be favourable or unfavourable. During unfavourable conditions, these spores are protected by a tough coat. Once favourable conditions return, they germinate and grow into new hyphae.<br />

<p>Question 17.<br />
What is the dispersion of white light? State its cause. Draw a ray diagram to show the dispersion of white light by a glass prism. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its seven constituent colours, when it passes through a glass prism, is called the dispersion of light.<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48379021947_b92ef1d7a3_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2017 Outside Delhi Term 2 Set II Q17" width="516" height="280" /><br />
When a beam of white light enters a prism, it gets refracted at point and splits into its seven constituent colours i.e.r violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange and red i.e., VIBGYOR. This splitting of light rays occurs because of the different angles of bending for each colour and this different angles of bending occurs because different components of light have different refractive indices or speed of different colours is different in glass when passing through the glass prism. When a beam of sunlight is allowed to fall on one of the rectangular surfaces of the glass prism, we obtain a coloured spectrum with red and violet colour at its extremes.</p>
<h3>CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2017 Outside Delhi Term 2 Set III</h3>
<p>Note: Except for the following questions, all the remaining questions have been asked in previous sets.</p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Write the molecular formula of the 2nd and 3rd member of the homologous series where the first member is ethyne. [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
1. CH<sub>3</sub>C = CH (propyne), n = 3<br />
2. CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>C = CH (Butyne), n = 4</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Why is variation important for a species? [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
Variation is necessary for the survival of species as variation makes species more adapted to survive with the change environmental conditions. The vari? t species are more adapted to changing the environment. Therefore, they can survive better and reproduce to pass the genes to the offsprings.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
In the following food chain, 20,000 J of energy was available to the plants. How much energy would be available to man in this chain?<br />
Plants → Sheep → Man [1]<br />
Answer:<br />
In the given food chain, according to 10% law,<br />
Plants(20,000J) → Sheep(2000J) → Man(200J)<br />
Amount of energy available to the man is 200 J.</p>
<p>Question 5.<br />
You being an environmentalist are interested in contributing to the conservation of natural resources. List four activities that you can do on your own. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
We can bring the following activities in practice to conserve the natural resources:</p>
<ol>
<li>We can reuse and recycle the paper products so that cutting of trees could be reduced.</li>
<li>We can reduce the consumption of water by avoiding its wastage in our day to day activities.</li>
<li>We can also adopt water harvesting like rainwater harvesting.</li>
<li>We can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels by using public transport, carpool and switching off vehicles at signals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Why are coal and petroleum categorised as natural resources ? Give a reason as to why they should be used judiciously. [2]<br />
Answer:<br />
Natural resources are those living and non-living sources available in our environment which are exploited to meet the human requirements. Since coal and petroleum are actually the fossils of the dead plants and animals respectively, hence considered as natural resources.</p>
<p>Both coal and petroleum are used as important sources of energy since long time. Both these fossil fuels were formed millions of years ago from the degradation of biomass. Since these fossil fuels are non-renewable in nature and they have limited reserves, therefore they must be used judiciously, otherwise they will get exhausted very soon.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
What is periodicity in properties of elements with reference to the Modem Periodic Table? Why do all the elements of the same group have similar properties? How does the tendency of elements to gain electrons change as we move from left to right in a period ? State the reason of this change. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The occurence of the elements with similar properties after certain regular intervals when they are arranged in increasing order of atomic number is called periodicity. The periodic repetition of the properties is due to the recurrence of similar valence shell configuration after regular interval.</p>
<p>The elements in a group have same valence electrons thus similar chemical properties. In a period, tendency to gain electrons increases from left to right. This tendency increases because the hold of nucleus on the outermost electrons becomes weak thus it becomes easy to eject the electron.</p>
<p>Question 10.<br />
Write the electronic configuration of two elements X and Y whose atomic numbers are 20 and 17 respectively. Write the molecular formula of the compound formed when element X reacts with element Y. Draw electron-dot structure of the product and also state the nature of the bond formed between both the elements. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
X = 20; 2, 8, 8, 2<br />
Y = 17; 2, 8, 7<br />

The nature of bond will be ionic.</p>
<p>Question 12.<br />
What is an organic evolution ? It cannot be equated with progress. Explain with the help of a suitable example. [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Organic evolution refers to the gradual changes that occur in living organisms over time. It is the result of change in the genetic makeup of the organism due to mutation and other sources of variations. „ The favourable mutations are accepted by nature and provide the organism an adaptive advantage, leading to its evolution. Evolution cannot always be equated to progress because it does not always lead to the formation of a new species. In fact, most of the times, it leads to the generation of diversity. One species does not necessarily get eliminated to give rise to a new ones in prevailing environments. Also, the newly formed species may have complex organisation because of evolution but it cannot be considered better than the earlier species. Many older and simpler designs still survive in the nature. For example, bacteria are one of the simplest life forms on earth and still they can survive in the most adverse conditions, such as hot springs, deep sea thermal vents etc. Therefore, having more complex body designs does not make any species superior to others.</p>
<p>Question 13.<br />
List the two types of reproduction. Which one of the two is responsible for bringing in more variations in its progeny and how? [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
Reproduction methods are of two types: Sexual and Asexual. Out of these, sexual reproduction brings more variation in organisms. In sexual reproduction fusion of male and female gametes from different organisms occurs. Since the fusion of gametes come from two different individuals, the offsprings exhibit more diversity of characters. Also during gamete formation, meiosis occurs which brings new combinations of genes. Both these factors lead to more variations in the progeny.</p>
<p>Question 16.<br />
&#8220;A lens can form a magnified erect image as well as magnified inverted image of an object placed in front of it.&#8221; State the nature of this lens and draw ray diagrams to justify the above statement. Mark the positions of O, F and 2F in the diagram.<br />
Answer:<br />
Convex/Converging lens.<br />
Two ray diagrams are drawn to show it-<br />
(a) When object is placed between O and F1, the image formed is magnified, Virtual and erect.<br />

<p>Question 17.<br />
What is &#8220;dispersion of white light&#8221;? Draw a labelled diagram to illustrate the recombination of the spectrum of white light. Why is it essential that the two prisms used for the purpose should be identical and placed in an inverted position with respect to each other? [3]<br />
Answer:<br />
The phenomenon of splitting of white light into its constituent colours on passing through a prism is known as the dispersion of white light. This splitting of the light rays occurs because of the different angles of bending for each colour and this different angles of bending occurs because different component of light faces different refractive index (or speed of different colours is different) when passing through the glass prism.<br />
<img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48378878241_28b26c2578_o.png" alt="CBSE Previous Year Question Papers Class 10 Science 2017 Outside Delhi Term 2 Set III Q17" width="397" height="175" /><br />
It is essential that the two prisms used for the purpose should be identical and placed in an inverted position with respect to each other so that the second prism completely nullifies the dispersion caused by the first prism and we get pure white light.</p>
