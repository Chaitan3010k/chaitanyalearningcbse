<strong>4.Energy Band</strong> In a crystal due to interatomic interaction, valence electrons of one atom are shared by more than one atom in the crystal. Now, splitting of energy level takes place. The collection of these closely spaced energy levels are called an energy band.<br />
<strong>5.Valence Band</strong> Valence band are the energy band which includes the energy levels of the valence electrons.<br />
<strong>6.Conduction Band</strong> Conduction band is the energy band above the valence<br />

<p><strong>7.State the reason, why GaAs is most commonly used in making of a solar cell. [All India 2008]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.solar radiation is nearly 1.5 eV. In order to have photo excitation, the energy of radiation (hv) must be greater than energy band gap (E<sub>g</sub>). Therefore, the semiconductor with energy band gap about 1.5 eV or lower than it and with higher absorption coefficient is likely to give better solar conversion efficiency. The energy band gap for Si is about 1.1 eV, while for GaAs, it is about 1.53 eV. The GaAs is better inspite of its higher band gap than Si because it absorbs relatively more energy from the incident solar radiations being of relatively higher absorption coefficient.</p>

<strong>Ans.</strong>At O° K temperature, an intrinsic semiconductor behaves like a perfect insulator</p>
<p><strong>9.Why should a photo diode be operated at reverse bias?[All India 2008]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.The photodiodes are used to detect the optical signals. The fraction change in minority carrier in case of reverse biased diode is easily measurable than that of forward biased. That is why photodiode is operated at reverse bias.</p>

<p><strong>10.Explain, with the help of a circuit diagram, the working of a p-n junction diode as a half-wave rectifier. [ah India 2014]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.<strong>p-n Junction Diode as a Half-Wave Rectifier</strong> AC voltage to be rectified is connected to the primary coil of a step-down transformer. Secondary coil is connected to the diode through resistors Rj,, across which output is obtained.<br />
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/660/23214136229_721ca7ca7d_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-33" width="402" height="166" /><br />
<strong>Working</strong> During positive half cycle of the input AC, the p-n junction is forward biased. Thus, the resistance in p-n junction becomes low and current flows. Hence, we get output in the load.<br />
During negative half cycle of the input AC, the p-n junction is reverse biased. Thus, the resistance of p-n junction is high and current does not flow. Hence, no output in the load. So, for complete cycle of AC, current flows through the load resistance in the same direction.<br />

<p><strong>12.Distinguish between a metal and an insulator on the basis of energy band diagram. [Foreign 2014]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.(i) <strong>Metal</strong> For metals, the valence band is completely filled and the conduction band can have two possibilities either it is partially filled with an extremely small energy gap between the valence and conduction bands or it is empty, with two bands overlapping each other as shown below:<br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5751/23499664571_64c7092923_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-36" width="375" height="122" /><br />
(ii) On applying an small even electric field, metals can conduct electricity.<br />
(i) <strong>Insulators :</strong> for insulator, the energy gap between the conduction and valence bands are very large, also the conduction band is practically empty, as shown below:<br />

<p><strong>14.Explain the term &#8216;drift velocity&#8217; of electrons in conductor. Hence, obtain an expression for the current through a conductor in terms of &#8216;drift velocity&#8217;.[All India 2013]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.&#8217;Drift velocity&#8217; of electrons in a conductor</strong><br />
Metals contain a large number of free electrons. These electrons are in continuous random motion. Due to the random motion, the free electrons collide with positive metal ions with high frequency and undergo change in direction at each collision. So, the average velocity for the electrons in a conductor is zero.Now, when this conductor is connected to a source of emf, an electric field is established in the conductor, such that E = V/L<br />
where, V = potential difference across the conductor and L = length of the conductor. The electric field exerts an electrostatic force -Ee on each free electron in the conductor. The acceleration of each electron is given by<br />

where, e = electric charge on electron and m = mass of electron.<br />
The average velocity of all the free electrons in the conductor is called the drift velocity of free electrons of the conductor.<br />

<p><strong>17.Give two advantages of LED&#8217;s over the conventional incandescent lamps.[Foreign 2012]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>When we apply sufficient voltage to LED, electron move across the junction into p-region and get attracted to the holes there. Thus, electrons and holes recombine. During each recombination, the electric potential energy is converted into the electromagnetic energy and a photon of light with a characteristic frequency is emitted, this is how, LED works.<br />
Advantages of LEDs over incandescent lamps<br />
(i) Since, LEDs do not have a filament that can burn out, hence, they last longer.<br />
They do not get hot during use.<br />

<strong>Ans</strong>.When photo diode is illuminated with light due to breaking of covalent bonds, equal number of additional electrons and holes comes into existence whereas fractional change in minority charge carrier is much higher than fractional change in majority charge carrier. Since, the fractional change of minority carrier current is measurable significantly in reverse bias than that of forward bias. Therefore, photo diode are connected in reverse bias.</p>
<p><strong>19.Name the semiconductor device that can be used to regulate an unregulated DC power supply. With the help of 7-V characteristics of this device, explain its working principle.[Delhi 2011]</strong><br />

<p><strong>21.Explain, how a depletion region is formed in a junction diode?[Delhi 2011]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> With the formation of p-n junction, the holes from p-region diffuse into the n-region and electrons from n-region diffuse into p-region and electron-hole pair combine and get annihilated.<br />
This input produces potential barrier, V<sub>B </sub>across in junction which opposes the further diffusion through the junction. Thus, small region forms in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carrier and has only immotile ions is called the depletion region.</p>
<p><strong>22.Draw the circuit diagram showing how a p-n junction diode is</strong><br />

(ii) increases in reverse bias.</p>
<p><strong>23.Carbon and silicon both have four valence electrons each, then how are they distinguished? [Delhi 2011 c]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.The four valence electrons of carbon are present in second orbit while that of silicon in third orbit. So, energy required to extricate an electron from silicon is much smaller than carbon.<br />
Therefore, the number of free electrons for conduction in silicon is significant on contrary of carbon. This makes silicon conductivity much higher than carbon. This is the main distinguishable property.</p>

<p><strong>33.Draw V-I characteristics of a p-n junction diode. Answer the following questions, giving reasons.</strong><br />

<strong> Name any semiconductor device which operates under the reverse bias in the breakdown region.</strong><br />
<strong> [All India 2012]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong><br />
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/686/23556002096_295de17a51_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-62" width="374" height="315" /><br />
(i)Under the reverse bias condition, the holes of p-side are attracted towards the negative terminal of the battery and the electrons of the n-side are attracted towards the positive terminal of the battery. This increases the depletion layer and the potential barrier. However, the minority charge carriers are drifted across the junction producing a small current.<br />
At any temperature, the number of minority carriers is constant, so there is the small current at any applied potential. This is the reason for the current under reverse bias to be almost&#8217;independent of applied potential. At the critical voltage, avalanche breakdown takes place which results in a sudden flow of large current.<br />
(ii) At the critical voltage, the holes in the n-side and conduction electrons in the p-side are accelerated due to the reverse bias voltage. These minority carriers acquire sufficient kinetic energy from the electric field and collide with a valence electron.<br />
Thus, the bond is finally broken and the valence electrons move into the conduction band resulting in enormous flow of electrons and thus, formation of hole-electron pairs. Thus, there is a sudden increase in the current at the critical voltage.<br />
Zener diode is a semiconductor device which operates under the reverse bias in the breakdown region.</p>

During formation of p-n junction, diffusion of charge takes place. As, soon as p-type semiconductor is joined with n-type semiconductor, diffusion of free charges across the junction starts.<br />
<strong>For explanation of formation p-n junction</strong><br />
With the formation of p-n junction, the holes from p-region diffuse into the n-region and electrons from n-region diffuse into p-region and electron-hole pair combine and get annihilated.<br />
This input produces potential barrier, V<sub>B </sub>across in junction which opposes the further diffusion through the junction. Thus, small region forms in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carrier and has only immotile ions is called the depletion region.<br />
Potential barrier The potential distribution near the p-n junction is known as potential barrier</p>

<p><strong>37.(i)Why are Si and GaAs preferred materials for solar cells?</strong><br />
<strong> (ii)Describe briefly with the help of a necessary circuit diagram, the working principle of a solar cell.[All India 2011 C]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (i) solar radiation is nearly 1.5 eV. In order to have photo excitation, the energy of radiation (hv) must be greater than energy band gap (E<sub>g</sub>). Therefore, the semiconductor with energy band gap about 1.5 eV or lower than it and with higher absorption coefficient is likely to give better solar conversion efficiency. The energy band gap for Si is about 1.1 eV, while for GaAs, it is about 1.53 eV. The GaAs is better inspite of its higher band gap than Si because it absorbs relatively more energy from the incident solar radiations being of relatively higher absorption coefficient.<br />

<p><strong>38.(i) Describe the working of Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).</strong><br />
<strong> (ii)Which semiconductors are preferred to make LEDs and why?</strong><br />
<strong> (iii)Give two advantages of using LEDs over conventional incandescent low power lamps.[All India 2011]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong>(i) Working of LED LED is a forward biased p-n junction which converts electrical energy into optical energy of infrared and visible light region.<br />
Being in forward bias, thin depletion layer and low potential barrier facilitate diffusion of electron and hole through the junction when high energy electron of conduction band combines with the low energy holes in valence band, then energy is released in the form of photon, may be seen in the form of light.<br />
(ii) Semiconductors with appropriate band gap (E<sub>g</sub>) close to 1.5 eV are preferred to make LED size GaAs, CdTe, etc.the other reasons to select these materials e high optical absorption, availability of raw material and low cost<br />
(iii) Uses of LEDs (a) LED can operate at very low voltage and consumes less power in comparison to incandescent lamps<br />
(b) Unlike the lamps, they take very less operational time and have long life.</p>

<strong> (i)forward biased and</strong><br />
<strong> (ii)reverse biased? [All India 2009]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> With the formation of p-n junction, the holes from p-region diffuse into the n-region and electrons from n-region diffuse into p-region and electron-hole pair combine and get annihilated.<br />
This input produces potential barrier, V<sub>B </sub>across in junction which opposes the further diffusion through the junction. Thus, small region forms in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carrier and has only immotile ions is called the depletion region.<br />

When the input voltage increases, then current through R, increase and hence, voltage drop across R<sub>p</sub> increases while voltage across the Zener diode remains constant. The voltage across Zener diode remains constant beyond Zener voltage and hence, same/constant regulated voltage is obtained across R<sub>L</sub>.<br />

Thus, fractional change in minority charge carrier (hole) is much higher than fraction change in majority charge carrier (electron). Also, minority charge carrier contribute in drift current in reverse bias.<br />
Thus, with incidence of light, fractional change in minority charge carrier is significant. Therefore,  photo diode should be connected in reverse bias for measuring light intensity.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">5Marks Questions</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>44.(i)State briefly the processes involved in the formation of p-n junction, explaining clearly how the</strong><br />
<strong> depletion region is formed.</strong><br />
<strong> (ii)Using the necessary circuit diagrams, show how the V-I characteristics of a p-n junction are obtained in (a) forward biasing (b) reverse biasing  How are these characteristics made use of in rectification? [Delhi 2014]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.(i) <strong>p-n Junction</strong> A p-n junction is an arrangement made by a close contact of n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor.There are various methods of forming p-n junction diode. In one method, an n-type germanium crystal is cut into thin slices called wafers. An aluminium film is laid on an n-type wafer which is then heated in an oven at a temperature of about 600°C. Aluminium then diffuses into the surface of wafer. In this way, a p-type semiconductor is formed on n-type semiconductor.<br />
<strong>Formation of Depletion Region in p-n Junction</strong> In an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is more than concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than that of concentration of electrons. During formation of p-n junction and due to the concentration gradient across p and n-sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side ( p—&gt; n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n —&gt; p).<br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/22955007743_608de1d969_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-69" width="368" height="172" /><br />
The diffused charge carriers combine with their counterparts in the immediate vicinity of the junction and neutralise each other, (l) Thus, near the junction, positive charge is built on n-side and negative charge on p-side This sets up potential difference across the junction and an internal electric field Ej directed from n-side to p-side. The equilibrium is established when the field £, becomes strong enough to stop further diffusion of the majority charge carriers (however, it helps the minority charge carriers to diffuse across the junction).The region on either side of the junction which becomes depleted (free) from the mobile charge carriers is called depletion region or <strong>depletion layer</strong>. The width of depletion region is of the order of 10<sup>-6</sup> m.The potential difference developed across the depletion region is called the potential barrier. Potential barrier depends on dopant concentration in the semiconductor and temperature of the junction.<br />
(ii) (a) <strong>Forward Biased Characteristics</strong><br />
The circuit diagram for studying forward biased characteristics is shown in the figure. Starting from a low value, forward bias voltage is increased step by step (measured by voltmeter) and forward current is noted (by ammeter). A graph is plotted between voltage and current. The curve so obtained is the forward characteristic of the diode.<br />

At the start when applied voltage is low, the current through the diode is almost zero. It is because of the potential barrier, which opposes the applied voltage. Till the applied voltage exceeds the potential barrier, the current increases very slowly with increase in applied voltage (OA portion of the graph).With further increase in applied voltage, the current increases very rapidly (AB portion of the graph), in this situation, the diode behaves like a conductor. The forward voltage beyond which the current through the junction starts increasing rapidly with voltage is called knee voltage. If line AB is extended back, it cuts the voltage axis at potential barrier voltage.<br />

In reverse biased, the applied voltage supports the flow of minority charge carriers across the junction. So, a very small current flows across the junction due to minority charge carriers.<br />
Motion of minority charge carriers is also supported by internal potential barrier, so all the minority carriers cross over the junction.Therefore, the small reverse current remains almost constant over a sufficiently long range of reverse bias, increasing very little with increasing voltage (OC portion of the graph). This reverse current is voltage independent upto certain voltage known as <strong>breakdown voltage</strong> and this voltage independent current &#8211; is called reverse saturation current.<br />
<strong>Use of p-n Junction Characteristics in Rectification</strong><br />
From forward and reverse characteristics, it is clear that current flows through the junction diode only in forward bias not in reverse bias i.e. current flows only in one direction</p>

In reverse biased, the applied voltage supports the flow of minority charge carriers across the junction. So, a very small current flows across the junction due to minority charge carriers.<br />
Motion of minority charge carriers is also supported by internal potential barrier, so all the minority carriers cross over the junction.Therefore, the small reverse current remains almost constant over a sufficiently long range of reverse bias, increasing very little with increasing voltage (OC portion of the graph). This reverse current is voltage independent upto certain voltage known as <strong>breakdown voltage</strong> and this voltage independent current &#8211; is called reverse saturation current.<br />
<strong>Use of p-n Junction Characteristics in Rectification</strong><br />
From forward and reverse characteristics, it is clear that current flows through the junction diode only in forward bias not in reverse bias i.e. current flows only in one direction<br />

During formation of p-n junction, diffusion of charge takes place. As, soon as p-type semiconductor is joined with n-type semiconductor, diffusion of free charges across the junction starts.<br />
<strong>For explanation of formation p-n junction</strong><br />
With the formation of p-n junction, the holes from p-region diffuse into the n-region and electrons from n-region diffuse into p-region and electron-hole pair combine and get annihilated.<br />
This input produces potential barrier, V<sub>B </sub>across in junction which opposes the further diffusion through the junction. Thus, small region forms in the vicinity of the junction which is depleted of free charge carrier and has only immotile ions is called the depletion region.<br />
Potential barrier The potential distribution near the p-n junction is known as potential barrier<br />

<strong> (iii)How do you obtain steady DC output from the pulsating voltage?[Delhi 2013 C]</strong><br />
<strong>Ans.(i) p-n Junction</strong> A p-n junction is an arrangement made by a close contact of n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor.There are various methods of forming p-n junction diode. In one method, an n-type germanium crystal is cut into thin slices called wafers. An aluminium film is laid on an n-type wafer which is then heated in an oven at a temperature of about 600°C. Aluminium then diffuses into the surface of wafer. In this way, a p-type semiconductor is formed on n-type semiconductor.<br />
<strong>Formation of Depletion Region in p-n Junction</strong> In an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is more than concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than that of concentration of electrons. During formation of p-n junction and due to the concentration gradient across p and n-sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side ( p—&gt; n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n —&gt; p).<br />

The diffused charge carriers combine with their counterparts in the immediate vicinity of the junction and neutralise each other, (l) Thus, near the junction, positive charge is built on n-side and negative charge on p-side This sets up potential difference across the junction and an internal electric field Ej directed from n-side to p-side. The equilibrium is established when the field £, becomes strong enough to stop further diffusion of the majority charge carriers (however, it helps the minority charge carriers to diffuse across the junction).The region on either side of the junction which becomes depleted (free) from the mobile charge carriers is called depletion region or <strong>depletion layer</strong>. The width of depletion region is of the order of 10<sup>-6</sup> m.The potential difference developed across the depletion region is called the potential barrier. Potential barrier depends on dopant concentration in the semiconductor and temperature of the junction.<br />

<strong>(iii)</strong> A full-wave bridge rectifier using four diodes (full-wave bridge rectifier) gives a continuous, unidirectional but pulsating output voltage or current.<br />

Reverse current is due to the flow of electrons from n —&gt; p and holes from p —» n. As, the reverse biased voltage increase the elecHic field across the junction, increases signiffcantly and when reverse bias voltage V &#8211; V<sub>z</sub>, then the electric field strength is high enough to pull the electrons from p-side and accelerated it to n-side.<br />
These electrons are responsible for the high current at the breakdown.<br />

Voltage regulator converts an unregulated DC output of rectifier into a constant regulated DC voltage, using Zener diode. The unregulated voltage is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance R<sub>s </sub>such that the Zener diode is reverse biased. If the input voltage increases, then current through R<sub>s</sub> apd Zener diode increases. Thus, the voltage drop across R^ increases without any change in the voltage drop across Zener diode. This is because of the breakdown region, Zener voltage remain constant even though the current through Zener diode changes.<br />
Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current through R<sub>s</sub> and Zener diode decreases. The voltage drop across R<sub>s</sub>, decreases without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode.<br />
Now, any change in input voltage results the change in voltage drop across R<sub>s</sub>, without any change in voltage across the Zener diode. Thus, Zener diode acts as a voltage regulator</p>

Potential barrier depends on dopant concentration in the semiconductor and temperature of the junction.<br />
(a) <strong>Forward Biased Characteristics</strong><br />
The circuit diagram for studying forward biased characteristics is shown in the figure. Starting from a low value, forward bias voltage is increased step by step (measured by voltmeter) and forward current is noted (by ammeter). A graph is plotted between voltage and current. The curve so obtained is the forward characteristic of the diode.<br />

At the start when applied voltage is low, the current through the diode is almost zero. It is because of the potential barrier, which opposes the applied voltage. Till the applied voltage exceeds the potential barrier, the current increases very slowly with increase in applied voltage (OA portion of the graph).With further increase in applied voltage, the current increases very rapidly (AB portion of the graph), in this situation, the diode behaves like a conductor. The forward voltage beyond which the current through the junction starts increasing rapidly with voltage is called knee voltage. If line AB is extended back, it cuts the voltage axis at potential barrier voltage.<br />

In reverse biased, the applied voltage supports the flow of minority charge carriers across the junction. So, a very small current flows across the junction due to minority charge carriers.<br />
Motion of minority charge carriers is also supported by internal potential barrier, so all the minority carriers cross over the junction.Therefore, the small reverse current remains almost constant over a sufficiently long range of reverse bias, increasing very little with increasing voltage (OC portion of the graph). This reverse current is voltage independent upto certain voltage known as <strong>breakdown voltage</strong> and this voltage independent current &#8211; is called reverse saturation current.<br />

Zener diode connected with unregulated DC voltage in reverse bias. When the input voltage increases, then current through R, increase and hence, voltage drop across R<sub>p</sub> increases while voltage across the Zener diode remains constant. The voltage across Zener diode remains constant beyond Zener voltage and hence, same/constant regulated voltage is obtained across R<sub>L</sub>.<br />

Thus, fractional change in minority charge carrier (hole) is much higher than fraction change in majority charge carrier (electron). Also, minority charge carrier contribute in drift current in reverse bias.<br />
Thus, with incidence of light, fractional change in minority charge carrier is significant. Therefore,  photo diode should be connected in reverse bias for measuring light intensity.</p>

Voltage regulator converts an unregulated DC output of rectifier into a constant regulated DC voltage, using Zener diode. The unregulated voltage is connected to the Zener diode through a series resistance R<sub>s </sub>such that the Zener diode is reverse biased. If the input voltage increases, then current through R<sub>s</sub> apd Zener diode increases. Thus, the voltage drop across R^ increases without any change in the voltage drop across Zener diode. This is because of the breakdown region, Zener voltage remain constant even though the current through Zener diode changes.<br />
Similarly, if the input voltage decreases, the current through R<sub>s</sub> and Zener diode decreases. The voltage drop across R<sub>s</sub>, decreases without any change in the voltage across the Zener diode.<br />
Now, any change in input voltage results the change in voltage drop across R<sub>s</sub>, without any change in voltage across the Zener diode. Thus, Zener diode acts as a voltage regulator<br />

<p>Diode conducts corresponding to positive half cycle and does not conduct during negative half cycle hence, AC is converted by diode into unidirectional pulsating DC. This action is known as half-wave rectification.</p>

<p><strong>54.(i) Draw the typical shape of the V-I characteristics of a p-n junction diode both in (a) forward</strong><strong>(b)reverse bias configuration. How do we infer, from these characteristics that a diode can be used to rectify alternating voltages?</strong><br />
<strong> (ii) Draw the circuit diagram of a full-wave rectifier using a centre-tap transformer and two p-n junction diodes. Give a brief description of the working of this circuit. [Delhi 2009 C]</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ans</strong>.<strong>(i)</strong> <strong>p-n Junction</strong> A p-n junction is an arrangement made by a close contact of n-type semiconductor and p-type semiconductor.There are various methods of forming p-n junction diode. In one method, an n-type germanium crystal is cut into thin slices called wafers. An aluminium film is laid on an n-type wafer which is then heated in an oven at a temperature of about 600°C. Aluminium then diffuses into the surface of wafer. In this way, a p-type semiconductor is formed on n-type semiconductor.<br />
<strong>Formation of Depletion Region in p-n Junction</strong> In an n-type semiconductor, the concentration of electrons is more than concentration of holes. Similarly, in a p-type semiconductor, the concentration of holes is more than that of concentration of electrons. During formation of p-n junction and due to the concentration gradient across p and n-sides, holes diffuse from p-side to n-side ( p—&gt; n) and electrons diffuse from n-side to p-side (n —&gt; p).<br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5729/22955007743_608de1d969_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-69" width="368" height="172" /><br />
The diffused charge carriers combine with their counterparts in the immediate vicinity of the junction and neutralise each other, (l) Thus, near the junction, positive charge is built on n-side and negative charge on p-side This sets up potential difference across the junction and an internal electric field Ej directed from n-side to p-side. The equilibrium is established when the field £, becomes strong enough to stop further diffusion of the majority charge carriers (however, it helps the minority charge carriers to diffuse across the junction).The region on either side of the junction which becomes depleted (free) from the mobile charge carriers is called depletion region or <strong>depletion layer</strong>. The width of depletion region is of the order of 10<sup>-6</sup> m.The potential difference developed across the depletion region is called the potential barrier. Potential barrier depends on dopant concentration in the semiconductor and temperature of the junction.<br />
(a) <strong>Forward Biased Characteristics</strong><br />
The circuit diagram for studying forward biased characteristics is shown in the figure. Starting from a low value, forward bias voltage is increased step by step (measured by voltmeter) and forward current is noted (by ammeter). A graph is plotted between voltage and current. The curve so obtained is the forward characteristic of the diode.<br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5808/23473531182_9e935b7028_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-70" width="350" height="292" /><br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5693/23556001526_95338aca11_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-71" width="470" height="341" /><br />
At the start when applied voltage is low, the current through the diode is almost zero. It is because of the potential barrier, which opposes the applied voltage. Till the applied voltage exceeds the potential barrier, the current increases very slowly with increase in applied voltage (OA portion of the graph).With further increase in applied voltage, the current increases very rapidly (AB portion of the graph), in this situation, the diode behaves like a conductor. The forward voltage beyond which the current through the junction starts increasing rapidly with voltage is called knee voltage. If line AB is extended back, it cuts the voltage axis at potential barrier voltage.<br />
(b)<strong> Reverse Biased Characteristics</strong><br />
The circuit diagram for studying reverse biased characteristics is shown in the figure.<br />
<img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5768/23286354160_9c4ca05831_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-72" width="373" height="312" /><br />
<img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/753/23286354080_0c35e5ab28_o.png" alt="important-questions-for-class-12-physics-cbse-semiconductor-diode-and-its-applications-t-14-73" width="337" height="278" /><br />
In reverse biased, the applied voltage supports the flow of minority charge carriers across the junction. So, a very small current flows across the junction due to minority charge carriers.<br />
Motion of minority charge carriers is also supported by internal potential barrier, so all the minority carriers cross over the junction.Therefore, the small reverse current remains almost constant over a sufficiently long range of reverse bias, increasing very little with increasing voltage (OC portion of the graph). This reverse current is voltage independent upto certain voltage known as <strong>breakdown voltage</strong> and this voltage independent current &#8211; is called reverse saturation current.<br />
<strong>Use of p-n Junction Characteristics in Rectification</strong><br />
From forward and reverse characteristics, it is clear that current flows through the junction diode only in forward bias not in reverse bias i.e. current flows only in one direction</p>
