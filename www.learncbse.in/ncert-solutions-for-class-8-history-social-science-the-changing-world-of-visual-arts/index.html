<h3>Class 8 History Chapter 11 The Making of the National Movement Ncert Textbook Questions Solved</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
Why were people dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s?<br />
Answer:<br />
The dissatisfaction against British rule was intensified in the 1870s and 1880s.<br />
1. The Arms Act was passed in 1878, which disallowed Indians from having arms.<br />
2. Same year the Vernacular Press Act was also enacted to silence the critics of the government.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Act allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything “objectionable”.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. In 1883, there was a furore over the attempt by the government to introduce the Ilbert Bill.</p>
<ul>
<li>The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians, and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country.</li>
<li>But the British (white) forced the government to withdraw the bill. Indians burst into anger. This event highlighted the whim of the British against Indians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Who did the Indian National Congress wish to speak for?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Indian National Congress wished to speak for the entire people belonging to different communities of India.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
What economic impact did the First World War have on India?<br />
Answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>World War I altered the economic and political situation in India.</li>
<li>Defence expenditure of the Government of India rose manifold. As a consequence taxes on individual incomes and business profits increased several times.</li>
<li>Increased military expenditure and demands for war supplies, resulted in a sharp rise in prices, causing great difficulties for the common people.</li>
<li>Demand for industrial goods (jute bags, cloth, rails) and a decline of imports from other countries led to the expansion of Indian industry. So, Indian business groups earned a huge profit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 4.<br />
What did the Muslim League resolution of 1940 ask for?<br />

<li>Legislative councils should be introduced in provinces where it did not exist.</li>
<li>It demanded that Indians be placed in high positions in the government.</li>
<li>For this, it called for civil service examinations to be held in India as well, not just in London.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The separation of the judiciary from the executive</li>

<ul>
<li>The salt tax</li>
<li>Good treatment of Indian laborers abroad</li>
<li>The sufferings of forest dwellers.</li>

<ul>
<li>They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Congress talked about many other issues concerned with the Indians, besides those of professional groups, zamindars, and industrialists.<br />
7. The Moderates felt that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice.</p>
<ul>
<li>So they would accept these demands if they made the government aware of the feelings of Indians.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
How was the politics of the Radicals within the Congress different from that of the Moderates?<br />
Answer:<br />
The Radicals within Congress cherished different opinions. They had a deep faith in action and wanted to drive away from the foreigners as soon as possible. They criticised the Moderates for their “politics of prayers’ and gave emphasis on self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must fight for swaraj. Unless they fought against the British rule unitedly, they would not bring independence to their country.</p>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Discuss the various forms of the Non-Cooperation Movement took in different parts of India. How did people understand Gandhiji?<br />
Answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, wished to start a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement.</li>
<li>Gandhiji supported their call. He urged the Congress to campaign against “Punjab wrongs” (Jallianwala massacre), the Khilafat wrong and demand</li>
<li>Different classes and groups, interpreting Gandhiji’s call in their own manner, protested in their own ways. Thus, people linked their movements to local grievances.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants organised non-violent campaigns against the high land revenue demand of the British.</li>
<li>In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were</li>
<li>In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants staged a number of “forest satyagrahas” by sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing fee.</li>
<li>In many forest villages, peasants declared swaraj and believed that “Gandhi Raj” would be established.</li>
<li>In Sind (now in Pakistan), Muslim traders and peasants supported the Khilafat call wholeheartedly.</li>
<li>In Bengal, the Khilafat/Non-Cooperation alliance gave a strong communal unity and strength to the national movement.</li>
<li>In Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs removed corrupt mahants—supported by the British—from their gurdwaras.</li>
<li>In Assam, tea garden labourers shouted “Gandhi Maharaj ki Jaif. They demanded a big increase in their wages. They left the British-owned plantations declaring that they were following Gandhiji’s wish.</li>
<li>In the Assamese Vaishnava, songs of the period the reference to Krishna, was Substituted by “Gandhi Raja”.</li>

<ul>
<li>People thought of Gandhiji as a messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty.</li>
<li>Gandhiji wished to build class unity, not class conflict, yet peasants could imagine that he would help them in their fight against zamindars.</li>
<li>Agricultural labourers believed Mahatma Gandhi would provide them land and get taxes reduced.</li>
<li>Common people credited Gandhiji with their own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 8.<br />
Why did Gandhiji choose to break the salt law?<br />
Answer:<br />
Gandhiji was very much worried about the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Gandhiji thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food and is required equally by the rich and the poor. Hence he decided to break this law in anticipation that people from all walks of life would extend their support. Needless to say that Gandhiji’s Salt March became very successful.</p>
<p>Question 9.<br />
Discuss those developments of the 1937 &#8211; 47 period that led to the creation of Pakistan.<br />
Answer:<br />
Developments of 1937-1947 period Leading to the creation of Pakistan:</p>
<ul>
<li>Muslim league was formed in 1906 but Congress’s failure to mobilise the Muslim masses in the 1920s allowed the League to widen its social support.</li>
<li>In Election results of 1937, they got very less seats, even in areas where a large number of Muslims lived, made them feel as a minority community.</li>
<li>In 1940 two nation theory was floated by them.</li>
<li>Elections to the provinces were again held in 1946. Congress did well in the “General” constituencies but the the league&#8217;s success in the seats reserved for Muslims was spectacular. So the league persisted with its demand for “Pakistan”.</li>
<li>In March 1946 the British cabinet sent a three-member mission to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India.</li>
<li>After the failure of the Cabinet Mission, the Muslim League decided on mass agitation for winning its Pakistan demand and announced 16 August 1946 as “Direct Action Day”.</li>
<li>On this day riots broke out in Calcutta, lasting several days and resulting in the death of thousands of people, mostly Hindus.</li>
<li>By March 1947 violence spread to different parts of northern India.</li>
<li>With mass agitation, India was partitioned in 1947 and Pakistan was born.</li>

<h4>Class 8 History Chapter 11 The Making of the National Movement  Long Answer Type Questions</h4>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What was the Rowlatt Act? Give an account of the Rowlatt Satyagraha.<br />
Answer:<br />
The British passed the Rowlatt Act in the year 1919. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. The Act was very repressive and therefore it enraged Indians. Prominent leaders of the freedom struggles such as Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, etc. felt that the government had no right to restrict the basic freedoms of people. They viewed the Act as devilish and tyrannical. Gandhiji decided to oppose this Act. He asked people of India to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to the Act, as a day of “humiliation and prayer’ and hartal. He organised Satyagraha Sabhas to launch the movement.</p>
<p>The Rowlatt Satyagraha spread far and wide. It became the first All- India struggle against the British government. In April 1919 several demonstrations and hartals took place in the country. But the government suppressed them taking brutal measures. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the climax of its brutality. This incident took place on 13 April in Amritsar on Baishakhi day. Thousands of people had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate the occasion. General Dyre opened fire on them all of a sudden.<br />
Both Hindu and Muslim unitedly criticised the British action.</p>
<p>Question 2.<br />
Describe Gandhi’s march to Dandi.<br />
Answer:<br />
Gandhiji felt that Purna Swaraj would not come on its own. It had to be fought for. He was very much worried about government’s Salt Law. In 1930, he decided to break this law.<br />

According to the law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi and other prominent leaders of the freedom struggle thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food. Both the rich and the poor needed it equally. Gandhiji felt that his Salt March would become popular and would represent the genral desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by all. On 6 April, 1930, Gandhiji alongwith his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi. Here, they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt.</p>
<p>A large number of people including women participated in this historic march. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were arrested and sent to jail. But the movement played a significant role in achieving freedom of India.</p>
<p>Question 3.<br />
Under what circumstances did Gandhiji initiate the Quit India Movement?<br />
Answer:<br />
In September 1939, the Second World War broke out. The. British government in India needed help from the Indian leaders. The leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to accept the demand. This enraged the Congress ministries. They all resigned to show their protest.<br />
Mahatma Gandhi was deeply perturbed. He now decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British rule in the middle of the Second World War. This movement came to be known as the Quit India Movement. Gandhiji thought that the British must Quit India without further delay. He raised the slogan ‘do or die’ which spread among the common mass very soon. But at the same time he warned the people not to be violent in any condition.</p>
<p>The British took repressive measures. Gandhiji along with other leaders were sent to jail immediately. But this did not prevent the movement from spreading. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join the movement. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In several areas people set up their own governments. The British tried to repress these developments severely. About 90,000 people were arrested and wound 1,000 killed in police firing. But the movement did not go in vain. It brought freedom very close.</p>
