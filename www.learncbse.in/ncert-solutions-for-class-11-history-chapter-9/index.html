<h3>Class 11 History Chapter 9 NCERT Textbook Questions Solved</h3>
<p>Question 1.<br />
How did Britain&#8217;s involvement in wars from 1793 to 1815 affect British industries?<br />
Answer:<br />
Both Britain and France were at war between 1793 to 1815. The industries of Britain were badly affected with this war.

<p>Question 4.<br />
Indicate how the supply of raw materials affected the nature of British industrialization.<br />
Answer:<br />
Since 17th century, Britain had been importing bales of cotton cloth from India at exorbitant price. But after the entry of East India Company into India, it began to import along with cloth, raw cotton, which could be spun and woven into cloth in England. Till the early 18th century, the process of spinning had been very slow. The spinners were occupied throughout the day, while weavers waited idly to receive yarn. A lot of technological inventions closed the gap between the speed in spinning raw cotton into yarn, and weaving the yarn into fabric. The production shifted from the homes of spinners and weavers to factories.</p>

<p>Question 1.<br />
Industrial Revolution with its demand for raw material and markets made nations more dependent on one another. How?<br />
Answer:<br />
So far the progress of industry is concerned two things are essential, i.e. raw material and market. In this situation, it is necessary to take the help of other nations who are self-sufficient in it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw Materials: For the supply of raw materials one country depends on another. Before independence, England was dependent on India for the raw materials of textile.</li>
<li>Market: If any country produces its products, it searches its market to sell it. For this, it depends upon another country. Their trade relations become closer and they become economically viable.</li>

<p>Question 2.<br />
The growth of trade union helped to put an end to the idea of Laissez faire. How?<br />
Answer:<br />
The workers were working hard for their owners. But they were not given their due amount. Sense of annoyance prevailed among them. So the workers put up their demands before the factory owners. They just wanted to crush their movement. So, the workers got united and started a movement against their owners. In this situation, the government was forced to end Laissez faire. For the well-being of workers, laws were made. The Act of 1819, prohibited the children under nine from working in factories. Trade unions were declared lawful. On this basis, it can be said that the development of trade unions ended Laissez faire.</p>

Answer:<br />
Industrialization has affected farming, transportation, communication and trade in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Farming: Due to industrialization, farming was highly affected. The demand for raw materials grew along with the industrialization. This demand enforced the farmers to adopt new methods to have more production. The new machines were invented for digging the soil, sowing and reaping. A number of farmers also became unemployed due to industrialization.</li>
<li>Transport: The pucca or metalled roads were built for safe and fast transportation of goods. Navigational canals were dug up to carry the goods and passengers. The steam engines were used to run railway trains. The rapid development of the means of transport made quite easy the transportation of finished goods and raw- materials from one country to another.</li>
<li>Communication: The invention of telegraphy and telephone brought revolution in the field of communication as sending and receiving of messages became easier. It was much helpful in the growth of industry.</li>

<p><strong>Class 11 History Chapter 3 Long Answer Type Questions</strong></p>
<p>Question 1.<br />
What were relative advantages of canal and railway transportation?<br />
Answer:<br />
Advantages of Canal Transportation</p>
<ul>
<li>Canals were mainly built to transport coal to cities. The bulk and weight of coal made its transport by road much slower and expensive than by barges on canals. Coal was mainly used for heating and lighting homes in cities. The demand for coal grew constantly. The first English canal was made by James Bindley in 1761. It was known as Worsely canal. Its main purpose was to carry coal from the coal deposits at Worsely (near Manchester) to that city; after the canal was completed.</li>
<li>Canals were usually built by big landowners. The confluence of canals created marketing centres in new towns. For example, the city of Birmingham owed its growth to its position at the heart of a canal system connecting London, the Bristol Channel, and the Mersey and Humber rivers. Between 1760 to 1790, 25 projects of canal building began. The period between 1788 to 1796 is known as canal mania. In it, there were another 46 new projects and over the next 60 years more than 4,000 miles of canal were built.</li>
</ul>
<p>Advantages of Railway Transportation</p>
<ul>
<li>Railways emerged as a new means of transportation available throughout the year. It was both cheap and fast, to carry passengers and goods.</li>
<li>In the second stage, the invention of the railways took the entire process of industrialisation. In 1801, Richard Trevithick had devised an engine called the &#8216;Puffing Devil’. In 1814, the railway engineer George Stephenson invented a lomocotive called ‘The Blutcher’. It could pull a weight of 30 tonnes upto a hill at 4 mph. The first railway line connected the cities of Stockton and Darlington in 1825. The distance between the two cities was just nine miles which could be covered in 2 hours at the speed of 24 KPh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 2.<br />

<li>Climate: The climate of Britain is humid. Because it is located near the sea. It was also one of the factors of Industrial Revolution.</li>
<li>Control over the colonies: British had established a large number of new colonies from where she could get the cheap raw materials and they could also serve as markets to sell the finished goods. Now they could sell their products in the colonies.</li>
<li>Shipping Industry: Shipping industry of England was much developed. Through ships, they could do their business in proper way. They could now transport the things from far away countries and also sell their products in the market.</li>
<li>Foreign Trade: The British had established their trade relations with another countries. Through this, they were able to expand their business. Foreign trade was also one of the main factors of Industrial Revolution.</li>

<p>Question 3.<br />
Discuss the socio-economic effects of the Industrial Revolution.<br />
Answer:<br />
The Industrial Revolution made tremendous impact on the life of British people. It affected not only their social life but economic life too. The socio-economic effects of Industrial Revolution are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>End of Cottage Industries: During the Industrial Revolution, a lot of new machines were prepared. Through these machines, numerous products were made. In cottage industries, it was not possible to manufacture these products. So, cottage industries in England have almost ended.</li>
<li>Development of new Industrial Towns: After the Industrial Revolution, a number of new industrial towns were set up. Before it, industrial towns were not much developed. As a result, the industrial towns like Birmingham, Lancashire, Manchester, etc. came into existence.</li>
<li>Growth of Agriculture: After the Industrial Revolution, new types of cropping machine, high-yielding seeds, fertilisers and new techniques of farming came into being. The farmers could now produce high yields. It also made their economic condition strong.</li>

<p>Question 4.<br />
How did the Industrial Revolution in England affect India&#8217;s economy?<br />
Answer:<br />
Industrial Revolution in England became the main cause of poverty in India. As India was a colony of England, it hit the Indian economy adversely. Due to the Industrial Revolution in England India&#8217;s economy was affected in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Industrial Revolution enabled England to produce more goods than needed there. Indian markets were flooded with the machine made goods from England. In this way, India became a big consumer of the English goods.</li>
<li>The Industrial Revolution in England threw the Indian artisans and handicrafts men out of job. As a result, small industries of India collapsed.</li>
<li>The British Government forced the Indian farmers to sell their raw materials at cheap rates to the British factory owners. The policy of exploiting the Indian economy for the benefit of the British capitalist was the direct consequence of the Industrial Revolution on India&#8217;s economy.</li>
<li>The unemployed artisans again became the farm labourers. They became a burden on the Indian agriculture. In this way, within very short-time, India became a poor country where agriculture was the only occupation of the people.</li>
<li>Before the Industrial Revolution, India was the major producer of cotton, woollen and silken clothes. Now India suffered a severe setback in these industries. Clothes made by the British mills were cheaper than the Indian clothes.</li>
<li>The Indian goods could not compete with the British goods. The British Government in India imposed heavy duties on the Indian goods and discouraged the Indian craftsmen ir. many ways so that they could never think of competing with the British goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 5.<br />
What sort of reforms through laws were made by the British government to improve the condition of workers? What were the weaknesses of these measures?<br />
Answer:<br />
The reforms through laws made by the British government were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Act of 1819: In 1819, laws were passed. It prohibited the employment of children under the age of nine in factories. It limited the hours of work of those between the age of 9 and 16 to 12 hours a day.</li>
<li>Act of 1833: Under the Act of 1833, chi&#8217;dren under the age of nine were permitted to be employed only in silk factories. This act also limited the hours of work for older children. A number of Factory Inspectors Act were also employed to ensure that the Act was enforced.</li>
<li>Ten Hours Bill: In 1847, the Ten Hours Bill was passed. This bill limited the hours of work for women and children and secured a ten-hour day for male workers.</li>
<li>The Mines Commission of 1842: The Mines Commission was set up in 1842. This commission revealed that working conditions in mines had become worst, because more children had been put to work in coal mines.</li>
<li>The Mines and Collieries Act of 1842: The Mines and Collieries Act of 1842 banned children under ten and women from working in underground mines.</li>
<li>Fielder&#8217;s Factory Act of 1847: In this act, it was laid down that children under eighteen and women should not work more than ten hours a day.</li>
</ul>
<p>The weaknesses of the these measures were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was the duty of factory inspectors to enforce the factory laws. But the inspectors were poorly paid and easily bribed by factory managers.</li>
<li>Parents lied about the real ages of their children, so that they could work and contribute to family incomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 6.<br />
Do you think that industrialisation affects farming, transportation, communication and trade?<br />
Answer:<br />
Industrialisation definitely makes its impact on farming, transportation, communication and trade in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Effects on Farming: After the Industrial Revolution, farming was highly affected. The inventions of new machines for agriculture were made. Now the machinery took the place of mankind. The farmers could sow, reap and harvest their products through machines. On the one side, production doubled but on the other side, the unemployment problem increased.</li>
<li>Effects on Transport: Roads were built for safe and fast transportation of goods. After industrialization, production of goods increased. So the businessmen had to send their goods to the different markets. Navigational canals were dug up to carry the goods and passengers. The rapid development of the means of transport made quite easy the transportation of finished goods. Now it became easier to send goods from one country to another.</li>
<li>Effects on the Means of Communication: After Industrial Revolution, there occurred a change in the field of communication. Telegraphy and telephone were invented. Now it became easier to receive and send the message. Now people could establish contact with others in very short time.</li>
<li>Effects on Trade: Trade was highly affected. As the products increased, it also encouraged trade. The international trade grew fast. It became easier for any industrialized country to import raw material and to export the finished goods to any part of the world market.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 7.<br />
Do you think the period between 1780 to 1820 is considered to be revolutionary for the growth of cotton or iron industries?<br />
Answer:<br />
For textile industries, the raw materials like cotton was not grown in Britain. So, Britain imported it from other countries to produce their products. After the Industrial Revolution, a number of inventions were made. Machines of high quality and capacity were made. The production also increased. To sell their products, the manufacturers sent them to other countries. Most of the products were sold in Indian markets. Since 1780, the imports and exports of British goods also increased. After the War of American Independence, its trade with North America was interrupted. But after 1780, its trading relations with North America also established again.</p>
<p>After 1815-20, economic changes also occurred. After French Revolution, industrialization was highly affected. Industrialization is mainly related with growth in investment in capital formation. After 1820, these things gradually appeared. Now technical progress was not only confined to these areas but also other areas too. Now its progress could be seen in other branches too. So, growth in the cotton or iron industries from 1780 to 1820 is not called revolutionary.</p>
<p>Question 8.<br />
What were the most favorable conditions for industrialization?<br />
Answer:<br />
The most favorable conditions for industrialization were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural resources: For the development of any industry, the availability of natural resources is must. It must be in abundance.</li>
<li>Capital: Sufficient capital is also necessary for the development of industries. Without the availability of capital, the development of industries is not possible.</li>
<li>Raw materials: Availability of raw-materials is also needed for the industrialisation. It must be in plenty. The raw materials include cotton, jute, sugarcane, etc.</li>
<li>Sources of energy: There must be sufficient sources of energy like electricity, oil or coal etc.</li>
<li>Markets: There must be potential markets for the consumers. If there is potential market, more finished goods will be consumed. And the economy will grow.</li>
<li>Transportation facilities: There must be efficient transportation facility. Roads, railway lines, shipping facilities etc. play a major role in the development of country.</li>
<li>Cheap labour: For the growth of any industry a number of labourers must be available at reasonable price.</li>
<li>Suitable climate: For the growth of any industry, suitable climate is must. If the climate is not suitable, production will also be affected. Worker’s health will also deteriorate. If their health is ill, there will be shortfall in production.</li>
<li>Govt’s policy: The policy of govt, is also one of the factors in the growth of industry. If the govt is stable, it will have positive results on the industry. The industry will grow at fast pace.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 9.<br />

</ul>
<p>Question 10.<br />
The invention of steam power proved helpful in the industrialization of Britain. How?<br />
Answer:<br />
Steam generates tremendous power. Power is essential for the growth of any industry. Water has been the major source of energy since a long time. It was just used as hydraulic power. But it had been limited only to certain areas, seasons and by the speed of flow of the water. Now it was used as steam. Pressure was provided by steam power at high temperatures.</p>
<p>Mining industries and Steam Power. Firstly, steam power was used in mining industries. There was a very serious problem in mining and that was flooding. The increase of demand for coal and metals increased. Efforts were also made to obtain them from deeper mines.</p>
<p>Thomas Savery built a model of steam engine in 1698 to drain mines. Its name was Miner’s Friend. It worked in shallow depth and under intense pressure.</p>
<p>Another steam engine was built by Thomas New comen in 1712. It had the major effect of losing energy due to the continuous cooling of the condensing cylinder.</p>
<p>Steam Power used in Factories. The steam engine had been used only in coal mines till 1769. James Watt developed his machine in 1769. He converted the steam engine from being a mere pump into a prime mover. This machine supplied energy to power machines in factories. Watt created the Soho Foundry in Birmingham in 1775 with the help of Matthew Boulton. In this foundry Watt&#8217;s steam engines were produced in great numbers. Steam engine technology was further developed after 1800 C.E. Following factors contributed to its development:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of lighter and stronger metals.</li>
<li>The manufacture of more accurate machine tools.</li>
<li>The spread of better scientific knowledge.</li>
<li>Steam engine technology was further developed with the use of higher, stronger metals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question 11.<br />
What are Trade unions? Discuss its aim while they were formed.<br />
Answer:<br />
Trade union is an organisation of workers who have banded together to achieve common goals in key areas, such as working conditions. Trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members and negotiates labour contracts with employers. This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies. The agreements negotiated by the union leaders are binding on the rank and file members and the employer and in some cases on other non-member workers. Trade unions became popular in many countries during the Industrial Revolution. Aims of the formation of Trade unions</p>
<ul>
<li>To fight for the well-being of the workers.</li>
<li>To fight against the injustice and malpractices in the industries.</li>
<li>To fight for regulating the working hours for the workers.</li>
<li>To fight for higher wages of the workers for their work done.</li>
<li>To demand better services facilities and the working conditions of the workers.</li>
<li>These were formed to maintain the harmonious relations between the employer and the employees.</li>
</ul>

<p>Passage 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">‘The man of wealth and pride<br />
Takes up a space that many poor supplied;<br />
Space for his lake, his park’s extended bounds,<br />
Space for his horses, equipage, and hounds;<br />
The robe that wraps his limbs in silken cloth<br />
Has robbed the neighboring fields of half their growth.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">— Oliver Goldsmith, The Deserted Village.</p>
<p>Questions<br />
(i) Who wrote this? Write the name of the book from which it was taken.<br />
(ii) What do you understand by the Enclosure Movement?<br />
(iii) Write any two effects of this movement.<br />
Answers:<br />
(i) It has been written by Oliver Goldsmith. It was taken from the book The Deserted Village.</p>
<p>(ii) The Enclosure Movement refers to a process in which landowner began to enlarge their farms by appropriation of common lands as private property or began to change open field system into closed fields.

<p>(iii) The effects of this movement are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The big landowners merged the holding of the small landholders.</li>
<li>Poor rural family began to migrate to towns/cities in search of livelihood, because due to industrialization more work was available for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passage 2.</p>
<p>In his novel Hard Times, Charles Dickens (1812-70), perhaps the most severe contemporary critic of the horrors of industrialization for the poor, wrote a fictional account of an industrial town he aptly called Coketown. &#8216;It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage. It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled. It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a stare of melancholy madness.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
(i) Who was Charles Dickens?<br />
(ii) About which period and the country he is talking about in this passage?<br />
(iii) Highlight any four social problems mentioned here.<br />
Answers:<br />
(i) Charles Dickens was a famous novelist who wrote a fictional account of an industrial town, Coketown.</p>
<p>(ii) In this passage, he is talking about the industrialization phase in Britain from 1780&#8217;s to 1850&#8217;s.</p>
<p>(iii) (a) Constant flow of rural migration to cities in search of work, increased the<br />
population in the cities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing slums in industrial towns.</li>
<li>Constant increase in thefts, crimes, street browls, etc.</li>
<li>Break down in family ties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passage 3.</p>
<p>D.H.Lawrence (1885-1930), British essayist and novelist, writing seventy years after Dickens, described the change in a village in the coal-belt, change which he had not experienced, but about which he had heard from older people.<br />
&#8216;Eastwood&#8230; must have been a tiny village at the beginning of the nineteenth century, a small place of cottages and fragmentary rows of little four-roomed miners&#8217; dwellings, the homes of the old colliers&#8230;But somewhere about 1820 the company must have sunk the first big shaft&#8230;and installed the first machinery of the real industrial colliery&#8230;Most of the little rows of dwellings were pulled down, and dull little shops began to rise along the Nottingham Road, while on the down-slope&#8230;the company erected what is still known as the New Buildings&#8230;little four-room houses looking outward into the grim, blank street, and the back looking into the desert of the square, shut in like a barracks enclosure, very strange.</p>
<p>Questions:<br />
(i) What do you know about D.H. Lawrence? What did he describe?<br />
(ii) Which particular class is he referring to?<br />
(iii) Write a few effects of early industrialization on villages and towns.<br />
Answers:<br />
(i) D.H. Lawrence was a famous British essayist and novelist. He described how changes occurred in the Eastwood village in the coal belt region due to industrialization.</p>
<p>(ii) He is referring to the labour class and the ordinary people of the Eastwood village.</p>
<p>(iii) Effects on Villages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thousands of villages lost their means of livelihood due to introduction of cotton machines.</li>
<li>Self-sufficiency of the village came to decline. It resulted in weakening of traditional rural bonds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Effects on Towns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic disparities started increasing between the rich and the poor in the cities.</li>
<li>The trend of child labour began to increase. They were now employed in dangerous coal mines.</li>
<li>Average lifespan of workers was lower than any other social group in cities.</li>
</ul>
