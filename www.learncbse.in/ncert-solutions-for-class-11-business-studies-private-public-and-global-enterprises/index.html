<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>III. Long Answer Type Questions</strong></span><br />
<strong> Question 1. Describe the Industrial Policy 1991, towards the public sector.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Development of a country originates from industrial development. Industrially developed countries are also economically prosperous. The 2nd Five Year Plan also called the Mahalnobis Model lead to the promotion of heavy and key industries in India. The period 1950 onwards witnessed development of infrastructure, research and development, establishment of large scale along with many small scale industries, co-existence of public and private sector enterprises, growth of both consumer and capital goods industries. The industrial sector made a significant contribution to agriculture and trade.<br />
The industrial policy plays a key role in influencing the foreign trade policy, fiscal policy, the monetary policy, the economic policy of the country. Government of India declared its 1st Industrial Policy Resolution (IPR) in 1948. It divided the industries into four categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>Industries that were to be state monopolies. These were limited to atomic energy, arms and ammunition and railways (3 in all).</li>
<li>Basic industries in which the state would have the exclusive right to new investment- 6 industries were included in this &#8211; iron and steel, shipbuilding, mineral oils, coal, aircraft production and telecommunication equipments.</li>
<li>Industries of national importance that the state might regulate and license in consultation with state government. 18 industries were placed in this category.</li>
<li>All other industries would be opened to the private sector without constraints. IPR 1948 remained in force till 1956. Two developments had taken place. One; the first plan which was initiated in 1951 was completed. Second, Parliament accepted the socialistic pattern of society. This led to IPR 1956.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Special features of IPR 1956 were as follows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Specific and all-important roles assigned to the public sector &#8211; all industries were classified into 3 groups. These groups were called schedules A,B,C.
<ul>
<li>Schedule A &#8211; Exclusive responsibility of state. There were 17 industries in this.</li>
<li>Schedule B &#8211; Progressively state-owned &#8211; 12 industries.</li>
<li>Schedule C &#8211; Generally left to private sector. The state reserved the right to enter this if need be.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Protection to cottage and small scale industries.</li>
<li>Cautious approach towards foreign capital.<br />
IPR 1956 remained the basis of industrial policy till 1991.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 2. What was the role of the public sector before 1991?</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Before 1991, public sector was supposed to perform the following role in India:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Rapid Economic Development:</strong> It was required to make efforts so that the rate of economic development accelerates.</li>
<li><strong>Provision of Infrastructure:</strong> Another expectation from public sector was to provide infrastructure in the form of better roads, more hospitals, more schools, better irrigation facilities etc.</li>
<li><strong>Sound Industrial Base:</strong> We also needed public sector to develop a sound industrial base because Private Sector either did not have huge capital required for these or were not interested in this sector as they had a long gestation period.</li>
<li><strong>Development of Backward Regions:</strong> Public sector also aimed at developing backward regions as it is necessary for the balanced development of a country. Private sector being profit minded does not take interest in investing in backward regions.</li>
<li><strong>Generation of Surplus:</strong> Another expectation from public sector was to generate a surplus that could be used for investment in other sectors whereby the growth rate could be accelerated.</li>
<li><strong>Creation of Employment Opportunities</strong>: Public sector also played its role in creating employment opportunities in organized sector so that poverty can be reduced and standard of living can be enhanced.</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Question 3. Can the public sector companies compete with the private sector in terms of profits and efficiency? Give reasons for your answer.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> It is difficult for a public sector undertaking to compete with a private sector undertaking in terms of profits due to following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Motive of public sector is not profit:</strong> Public sector works not for profit but for social welfare. It gives first priority to social welfare then it is almost impossible for it to compete with private sector enterprise on the basis of profit which mainly works for profit only.</li>
<li><strong>Public sector takes care of strategic industries:</strong> Public sector invests in strategic areas even when these industries have low return generating capacity and long gestation period. These industries do not give monetary returns but if we consider their return in development of our economy otherwise their return is really high.</li>
<li><strong>Public sector provides many facilities free of fast to the weaker section of society:</strong><br />
We can’t expect a government hospital or a government school to generate profits. Many public sector undertakings provide many facilities for free or at a very low cost due to the benefits that it gives to other sectors of the society.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is difficult for a public sector undertaking to compete with a private sector undertaking in terms of efficiency due to following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dependence on authorities for taking minor decisions:</strong> Public Sector undertakings follow a protocol for everything. It leads to delay in decision making and inefficiency in operations.</li>
<li><strong>Job security:</strong> Workers of Public Sector enjoy job security. It reduces their performance as they know that in spite of bad performance there is no fear of losing job.</li>
<li><strong>Red tapism and bureaucracy:</strong> In public sector undertakings there is red tapism and bureaucracy. It leads to inefficiency in operations.</li>

</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0000ff;">IV. Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS)</span></strong><br />
<strong>Question 1. “The basic rationale of public sector has changed significantly.” In the light of this statement explain any four initiatives taken by the government.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> In the industrial policy 1991, the Government of India introduced four major reforms in public sector.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduction in number of industries reserved for public sector:</strong> This number is reduced from 17 to 8 and to 3 industries only in 2001. These three industries are atomic energy, arms and rail transport.</li>
<li><strong>Memorandum of Understanding (MOU):</strong> Under this govt, lays down performance targets for the management and gives greater autonomy to hold the management accountable for the results.</li>
<li><strong>Disinvestment:</strong> Equity shares of public sector enterprises were sold to private sector and the public. It was expected that this would lead to improved managerial performance and better financial discipline.</li>
<li><strong> Restructure and revival:</strong> All public sectors, sick units were referred to Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR). Units which were potentially viable were restructured and which could not be revived were closed down by the board.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 2. “Global enterprises are giant both in size and operations.” Substantiate this statement.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> The statement is absolutely correct that global enterprises are giant both in size and<br />
operations.</p>
<ol>
<li>It has huge capital resources.</li>
<li> It involves foreign collaboration.</li>
<li> It uses advanced technology.</li>
<li>It leads to product innovation.</li>
<li> It makes use of marketing strategies.</li>
<li>It leads to expansion of market territory.</li>
<li>It makes use of centralized control.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 3. “MNC’s are in a position to exercise massive control on an economy.” Substantiate.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> MNC’s are in a position to exercise massive control on an economy because of the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>MNC’s are characterised by possessing huge financial resources. These huge financial resources give them economic power in the economy. They can afford to survive even during losses as well.</li>
<li> MNCs possess technological superiorities and are capable of conform to international standards and quality specifications.</li>
<li> They make use of aggressive marketing strategies for their products.</li>
<li>They have an established brand image in the market.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>V. Value Based Questions</strong></span><br />
<strong>Question 1. Multinational Companies have done more harm than good. Explain.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> Yes, I agree that Multinational Companies have done more harm than good. It is clear from the following disadvantages which it is creating for the economy.</p>
<ol>
<li>It disregards national priorities.</li>
<li>It leads to creation of monopoly.</li>
<li>It leads to depletion of natural resources.</li>
<li>It leads to technology obsolete .</li>
<li> It creates threat to national sovereignty.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Question 2. “Public sector has changed its role since 1991 a great deal”. Do you agree? Justify your answer.</strong><br />
<strong> Answer:</strong> The role and importance of public sector changed with passage of time.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Development of infrastructure:</strong> At the time of independence, India suffered from an acute shortage of heavy industries such as engineering, iron and steel, oil refineries, heavy machineries, etc. Because of huge investment requirement and long gestation period, private sector was not willing to enter these areas. The duty of development of basic infrastructure was assigned to public sector which it discharged quite efficiently.</li>
<li><strong>Regional balance:</strong> Earlier, most of the development was limited to a few areas like port towns. For providing employment to the people and for accelerating the economic development of backward areas many industries were set up by public sector in those areas.</li>
<li><strong>Economics of scale:</strong> In certain industries (like electric power plants, natural gas, petroleum, etc) huge capital and large base are required to function economically. Such areas were taken up by public sector.</li>
<li><strong>Control of monopoly and restrictive trade practices:</strong> These enterprises were also established to provide completion to private sector and to check their monopolies and restrictive trade practices.</li>
<li><strong> Import substitution:</strong> Public enterprises were also engaged in production of capital equipments which were earlier imported from other countries. At the same time public sector companies like STC and MMTC have played an important role in expanding exports of the country. Very important role was assigned to public sector but its performance was far from satisfactory which forced government to do rethinking on public enterprises.</li>
