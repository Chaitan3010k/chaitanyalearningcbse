<h3>Lakhmir Singh Science Class 8 Chapter 3 Short Answer Type Questions</h3>
<p>Question 16.<br />
What is a polymer? Name the natural polymer from which cotton is made.<br />
Answer:<br />
A synthetic fibre is made of small units which are joined together. These units are made of chemical substances. Such small units combine to form a large single unit called a polymer. Hence, a polymer is made of many repeating units. Polymers also occur in nature. For example, cotton is a natural polymer which is made from the cellulose. Cellulose is made up of a large number of glucose units.</p>
<p>Question 17.<br />
State the characteristics of synthetic fibres.<br />

<p>Question 53 B.<br />
What are thermosetting plastics? Give two examples of thermosetting plastics.<br />
Answer:<br />
Thermosetting plastics: The plastics which when moulded once, cannot be softened by heating are called thermosetting plastics. For example, Bakelite is a thermosetting plastic which is a poor conductor of heat and Melamine is a thermosetting plastic which is resistant to fire and can tolerate heat better than other plastics. It is used to make floor tiles, kitchenware and fire resistant fabrics. It is used to make electrical switches and handles of utensils.</p>
<p>Question 54.<br />
Explain why, thermoplastics become soft on heating but thermosetting plastics do not become soft on heating. Draw labelled diagrams to illustrate your answer.<br />
Answer:<br />
Thermoplastic materials are made of polymers which are linked by intermolecular forces, forming linear or branched structures. On the other hand, thermosetting plastics are those materials that are made by polymers joined together by chemical bonds, having a highly-crosslinked polymer structure. In case of thermoplastics, the shape hardens when it is cooled, but can be reshaped when heated up again. Polythene is a thermoplastic polymer. Its tangled polymer chains can uncoil and slide past each other, making it a flexible material. On the other hand, Thermosetting polymers, once moulded, cannot be softened when heated. They cannot be reshaped. Vulcanised rubber is a thermosetting polymer which is used to make tyres. Its polymer chains are joined together by cross-links, so they cannot slide past each other easily.<br />

<p>Question 78.<br />
Which of the following articles made of plastics ‘can be recycled’ and which cannot be recycled’ ? give reasons for your choice?<br />
Telephone instruments, plastic toys, cooker handles, plastic covering on electrical wires, electric switches, ballpoint pens, carry bags, plastic bottles, plastic chairs<br />
Answer:<br />
PVC (Polyvinyl chloride) bags, Plastic bottles and Plastic chairs are made of thermoplastics. These articles can be recycled. Thermoplastic materials are made of polymers which are linked by intermolecular forces, forming linear or branched structures. In case of thermoplastics, the shape hardens when it is cooled, but can be reshaped when heated up again. Polythene is a thermoplastic polymer. Its tangled polymer chains can uncoil and slide past each other, making it a flexible material.</p>
<p>Telephone instruments, Cooker handles, Electric switches and Ball point pens are made of Thermosetting plastics. Thermosetting plastics are those materials that are made by polymers joined together by chemical bonds, having a highly-crosslinked polymer structure. Thermosetting polymers, once moulded, cannot be softened when heated. They cannot be reshaped.</p>
<p>Question 79.<br />
Out of the following materials:<br />
cotton, nylon, terylene, wool, Pet, acrylic<br />
(a) which materials are polyesters?<br />
(b) which materials is a polyamide?<br />
(c) which material is used as a substitute for wool?<br />
(d) which material is used as a substitute for glass?<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Terylene and PET are polyesters. Polyester is the synthetic fibre which contains the organic group similar-to those which give fruits their sweet smell. PET is a very familiar form of polyester. It is used for making bottles and utensils which is replacing materials like glass.<br />
(b) Nylon is a polyamide. Nylon is the first fully synthetic fibre. It was prepared from coal, water and air. It is used for making parachutes and rock climbing ropes.<br />
(c) Acrylic is used as a substitute for wool. It is a synthetic fibre which appears to resemble wool. It is flexible, resistant to moth, oil and chemicals. The clothes made from acrylic are relatively cheap and are available in a variety of colours.<br />
(d) PET is a material used as a substitute for glass. It is a form of polyester. Polyester is the synthetic fibre which is made up of repeating units of a chemical called an ester. Esters are the chemicals which give fruits their smell. PET is used for making bottles, utensils, films and wires.</p>
