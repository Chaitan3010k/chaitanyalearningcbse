<p>Question 37.<br />
A wire of 20 Ω resistance is gradually stretched to double its original length. It is then cut into two equal parts. These parts are then connected in parallel across a 4.0 volt battery. Find the current drawn from the battery. (All India 2009)<br />
Answer:<br />
On stretching, the resistance of the wire will get to four times, i.e., 80 Ω as volume is constant and<br />
R \(\alpha\) l<sup>2</sup>.<br />
So the two equal parts will have a resistance of 40 Ω each.<br />
When connected in parallel, the equivalent resistance will be 20 Ω<br />

<p>Question 56.<br />
State Kirchhoff&#8217;s rules. Explain briefly how these rules are justified. (Delhi 2014)<br />
Answer:<br />
Kirchhoff&#8217;s rules.</p>
<ol>
<li>Kirchhoff&#8217;s junction rule : At any junction, the sum of the currents entering the junction is equal to the sum of currents leaving the junction.</li>
<li>Kirchhoff&#8217;s loop rule : The algebraic sum of changes in potential in any closed loop involving resistors and cells is zero.</li>
</ol>
<p>These two laws are justified on the basis of law of conservation of charge and the law of conservation of energy respectively.</p>

<p>Question 104.<br />
In the electric network shown in the figure, use Kirchhoffs rules to calculate the power consumed by the resistance R = 4 Ω. (Comptt. Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
-12 + 2I<sub>1</sub> + 4(I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>) = 0<br />
-12 + 2I<sub>1</sub> + 4 I<sub>1</sub> + 4I<sub>2</sub> = 0<br />
6I<sub>1</sub> + 4I<sub>2</sub> = 12 ⇒ 3I<sub>1</sub> + 2I<sub>2</sub> = 6 &#8230; (i)<br />
For loop ADFEA<br />
-4(I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>) + 6 = 0<br />
-4I<sub>1</sub> &#8211; 4I<sub>2</sub> = -6 ⇒ 2I<sub>1</sub> + 2I<sub>2</sub> = 3 &#8230; (ii)<br />
Solving (i) and (ii), we get<br />
I<sub>1</sub> = 3A and I<sub>2</sub> = -1.5A<br />
∴ Power consumed in 4Ω resistance (R) = I<sup>2</sup>R<br />
= (I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> × R<br />
= (3 &#8211; 1.5)<sup>2</sup> × 4 W<br />
= 9 watt</p>
<p>Question 105.<br />
In the electric network shown in the figure use Kirchhoffs rules to calculate the power consumed by the resistance R = 8 Ω. (Comptt. Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
In loop BCDA,<br />
I<sub>1</sub> × 4 + (I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>) × 8 = 12<br />
4I<sub>1</sub> + 8I<sub>1</sub> + 8I<sub>2</sub> = 12<br />
12I<sub>1</sub> + 8I<sub>2</sub> = 12<br />
∴ 3I<sub>1</sub> + 2I<sub>2</sub> = 3 &#8230; (Dividing by 4) &#8230; (i)<br />
In loop ADFE,<br />
(I<sub>1</sub>+ I<sub>2</sub>) × 8 = 8 =&gt; 8I<sub>1</sub>, + 8I<sub>2</sub> = 8<br />
∴ I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub> = 1 &#8230;(Dividing by 8)<br />
Solving equations (i) and (ii), we get<br />
I<sub>1</sub> = 1A and I<sub>2</sub> = 0A<br />
∴ Power consumed in 80 resistance (R) = I<sup>2</sup>R<br />
= (I<sub>1</sub> + I<sub>2</sub>)<sup>2</sup> × R<br />
= (1 + 0)<sup>2</sup> × 8 = 8 watt</p>
<p>Question 106.<br />
(a) State the underlying principle of a potentiometer. Why is it necessary to<br />
(i) use a long wire,<br />
(ii) have uniform area of cross-section of the wire and<br />
(iii) use a driving cell whose emf is taken to be greater than the emfs of the primary cells?<br />
(b) In a potentiometer experiment, if the area of the cross-section of the wire increases uniformly from one end to the other, draw a graph showing how potential gradient would vary as the length of the wire increases from one end.(Comptt. All India 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Principle of potentiometer: A potentiometer is a device used to measure potential difference.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117788" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-150.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 150" width="237" height="96" /><br />
Principle. When a current flows through a wire of uniform thickness, the potential difference between its two points is directly proportional to the length of the wire between these two points.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117789" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-151.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 151" width="167" height="24" /><br />
&#8230; when [K is called construction potential gradient]<br />
Reasons :<br />
(i) We use a long wire to have a lower value of potential gradient (i.e. a lower &#8216;least count&#8217; or greater sensitivity of the potentiometer).<br />
(ii) The area of cross section has to be uniform to get a &#8216;uniform wire&#8217; as per the principle of the potentiometer to ensure a constant value of resistance per unit length of the wire.<br />
(iii) The emf of the driving cell has to be greater than the emf of the primary cells as otherwise no balance point would be obtained.<br />
(b) Potential gradient K = \(\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{L}}\)<br />
Therefore the required graph is as shown here.<br />

Due to this electric field, the electrons gain a drift velocity V<sub>d</sub> opposite to direction of electric field. If q be the charge passing through the cross-section of wire in t seconds, then, current in wire, I = \(\frac{q}{t}\)</p>
<p>The distance transversed by each electron in time (t) = drift velocity × time = V<sub>d</sub>t</p>
<p>If we consider two planes P and Q at a distance V<sub>d</sub>t in a conductor, then the total charge flowing in time t will be equal to the total charge on the electrons present within the cylinder PQ.</p>
<p>The volume of this cylinder = cross sectional area × length = A V<sub>d</sub>t</p>
<p>If n is the number of free electrons in the wire per unit volume, then the number of free electrons in the cylinder = n(A V<sub>d</sub>t)<br />
If charge on each electron is -e (e = 1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C), then the total charge flowing through a cross-section of the wire,<br />

Hence, q<sub>1</sub> = (2.5) × (5) = 12.5 C<br />
(ii) For 5 sec to 10 sec, the current = 5A<br />
Hence, q<sub>2</sub> = 5 × (10 &#8211; 5) = 5 × 5 = 25 C<br />
q = q<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub> = 12.5 + 25 = 37.5 C</p>
<p>Question 113.<br />
Draw a circuit diagram of a potentiometer. State its working principle. Derive the necessary formula to describe how it is used to compare the emfs of the two cells. (Comptt. All India)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Principle : The basic principle of a potentiometer is that &#8220;when a constant current flows through a wire of uniform cross-sectional area and composition, the potential drop across any length of the wire is directly proportional to that length.<br />
\(v \propto l\)</p>
<p>Comparison of emf&#8217;s of two cells: First of all the ends of potentiometer are connected to a battery Bx,<br />
key K and rheostat Rh such that the positive terminal of battery B, is connected to end A of the wire. This completes the primary circuit.</p>
<p>Now the positive terminals of the cells C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> whose emfs are to be compared are connected to A and the negative terminals to the jockey J through a two-way key and a galvanometer (fig). This is the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Method:<br />
(i) By closing key K, a potential difference is established and rheostat is so adjusted that when jockey J’is made to touch at ends A and B of wire, the deflection in galvano¬meter is on both sides. Suppose in this position the potential gradient is k.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117835" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 196" width="409" height="275" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196.png 409w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><br />
(ii) Now plug is inserted between the terminals 1 and 3. so that cell C<sub>1</sub> is included in the secondary circuit and jockey J is slided on the wire at P<sub>1</sub> (say) to obtain the null point. The distance of P<sub>1</sub> from A is measured. Suppose this length is l<sub>1</sub>, i.e. AP<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117836" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 197" width="307" height="23" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png 307w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197-300x22.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /><br />
(iii) Now plug is taken off between the terminals 1 and 3 and inserted in between the terminals 2 and 3 to bring cell C<sub>2</sub> in the circuit. Jockey is slided on wire and null deflection position P<sub>2</sub> is noted. Suppose distance of P<sub>2</sub> from A is l<sub>2</sub> i.e. AP<sub>2</sub> = Z<sub>2</sub> The emf of cell C<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>2</sub> = kl<sub>2</sub> &#8230; (ii)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117838" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 198" width="312" height="46" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png 312w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /><br />
Thus emf&#8217;s of cells may be compared. Out of these cells if one is standard cell, then the emf of other cell may be calculated.<br />
(b) Causes for one sided deflection :<br />
(i) Potential difference between the ends of the potentiometer wire is less than the emf of the cell in the secondary circuit.<br />
(ii) The positive side of the driving cell is connected to the negative terminal of the cell in the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Question 114.<br />
With the help of the circuit diagram, explain the working principle of meter bridge. How is it used to determine the unknown resistance of a given wire? Write the necessary precautions to minimize the error in the result. (Comptt. All India 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
Metre Bridge is special case of Wheatstone Bridge<br />
It is a device based on Wheatstone bridge to determine the unknown resistance of a wire. Principle : Meter bridge is based on the principle of wheatstone bridge, i.e. when bridge is balanced<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117806" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-168.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 168" width="242" height="50" /><br />
Circuit : To find the unknown resistance S, the circuit is completed as shown in figure. The unknown resistance wire of resistance S is connected across the gap between points C and D and a resistance box (R) is connected across the gap between the points A and D. A cell, a rheostat and a key (K) is connected between the point A and C by means of connecting screws. In the experiment when the sliding jockey touches the wire AC at any point, then the wire is divided into two parts. These two parts AB and BC act as the resistances P and Q of the Wheatstone bridge. In this way the resistances of arms AB, BC, AD and DC form the resistances P, Q, R and S of Wheatstone bridge. Thus the circuit of meter bridge is the same as that of Wheatstone bridge.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117807" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 169" width="334" height="232" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169.png 334w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /><br />
Method : To determine the unknown resistance first of all key K is closed and a resistance R is taken in the resistance box in such a way that on pressing jockey B at end points A and C, the deflection in galvanometer is on both the sides. Now jockey is slided on wire at such a position that on pressing the jockey on the wire at that point, there is no deflection in the galvanometer G. In this position the points B and D are at the same potential, therefore the bridge is balanced. The point B is called the null point. The length of both parts AB and BC of the wire are read on the scale. The condition of balance of Wheatstone bridge is,<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117808" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 170" width="371" height="89" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170.png 371w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><br />
If r is the resistance per cm length of wire AC and l cm is the length of wire AB, then length of wire BC will be (100 &#8211; l) cm<br />
∴ P = resistance of wire AB = lr<br />
Q = resistance of wire BC = (100 &#8211; l)r<br />
Substituting these values in equation (i), we get<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117810" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 171" width="339" height="36" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png 339w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171-300x32.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /><br />
As the resistance (R) of wire (AB) is known, the resistance S may be calculated.</p>
<p>A number of observations are taken for different resistances taken in resistance box and S is calculated each time and the mean value of S is found.</p>
<p>Precautions:<br />
(i) In this experiment the resistance of the copper strips and connecting screws have not been taken into account. These resistances are called end-resistances. Therefore very small resistances cannot be found accurately by metre bridge. The resistance S should not be very small.<br />
(ii) The current should not flow in the metre bridge wire for a long time, otherwise the wire will become hot and its resistance will be changed.</p>
<p>Question 115.<br />
(i) Derive an expression for drift velocity of free electrons.<br />
(ii) How does drift velocity of electrons in a metallic conductor vary with increase in temperature? Explain. (All India)<br />

Answer:<br />
Metre Bridge is special case of Wheatstone Bridge<br />
It is a device based on Wheatstone bridge to determine the unknown resistance of a wire.<br />
Principle : Meter bridge is based on the principle of wheatstone bridge, i.e. when bridge is balanced<br />

Circuit : To find the unknown resistance S, the circuit is completed as shown in figure. The unknown resistance wire of resistance S is connected across the gap between points C and D and a resistance box (R) is connected across the gap between the points A and D. A cell, a rheostat and a key (K) is connected between the point A and C by means of connecting screws. In the experiment when the sliding jockey touches the wire AC at any point, then the wire is divided into two parts. These two parts AB and BC act as the resistances P and Q of the Wheatstone bridge. In this way the resistances of arms AB, BC, AD and DC form the resistances P, Q, R and S of Wheatstone bridge. Thus the circuit of meter bridge is the same as that of Wheatstone bridge.<br />

Method : To determine the unknown resistance first of all key K is closed and a resistance R is taken in the resistance box in such a way that on pressing jockey B at end points A and C, the deflection in galvanometer is on both the sides. Now jockey is slided on wire at such a position that on pressing the jockey on the wire at that point, there is no deflection in the galvanometer G. In this position the points B and D are at the same potential, therefore the bridge is balanced. The point B is called the null point. The length of both parts AB and BC of the wire are read on the scale. The condition of balance of Wheatstone bridge is,<br />

If r is the resistance per cm length of wire AC and l cm is the length of wire AB, then length of wire BC will be (100 &#8211; l) cm<br />
∴ P = resistance of wire AB = lr<br />
Q = resistance of wire BC = (100 &#8211; l)r<br />
Substituting these values in equation (i), we get<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117810" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 171" width="339" height="36" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png 339w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171-300x32.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /><br />
As the resistance (R) of wire (AB) is known, the resistance S may be calculated.</p>
<p>A number of observations are taken for different resistances taken in resistance box and S is calculated each time and the mean value of S is found.</p>
<p>Precautions:<br />
(i) In this experiment the resistance of the copper strips and connecting screws have not been taken into account. These resistances are called end-resistances. Therefore very small resistances cannot be found accurately by metre bridge. The resistance S should not be very small.<br />
(ii) The current should not flow in the metre bridge wire for a long time, otherwise the wire will become hot and its resistance will be changed.</p>

<p>Question 126.<br />
(a) State the working principle of a potentiometer. With the help of the circuit diagram, explain how a potentiometer is used to compare the emf&#8217;s of two primary cells. Obtain the required expression used for comparing the emfs.<br />
(b) Write two possible causes for one sided deflection in a potentiometer experiment. (Delhi 2012)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) Principle : The basic principle of a potentiometer is that &#8220;when a constant current flows through a wire of uniform cross-sectional area and composition, the potential drop across any length of the wire is directly proportional to that length.<br />
\(v \propto l\)</p>
<p>Comparison of emf&#8217;s of two cells: First of all the ends of potentiometer are connected to a battery Bx,<br />
key K and rheostat Rh such that the positive terminal of battery B, is connected to end A of the wire. This completes the primary circuit.</p>
<p>Now the positive terminals of the cells C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> whose emfs are to be compared are connected to A and the negative terminals to the jockey J through a two-way key and a galvanometer (fig). This is the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Method:<br />
(i) By closing key K, a potential difference is established and rheostat is so adjusted that when jockey J’is made to touch at ends A and B of wire, the deflection in galvano¬meter is on both sides. Suppose in this position the potential gradient is k.<br />

(ii) Now plug is inserted between the terminals 1 and 3. so that cell C<sub>1</sub> is included in the secondary circuit and jockey J is slided on the wire at P<sub>1</sub> (say) to obtain the null point. The distance of P<sub>1</sub> from A is measured. Suppose this length is l<sub>1</sub>, i.e. AP<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117836" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 197" width="307" height="23" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png 307w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197-300x22.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /><br />
(iii) Now plug is taken off between the terminals 1 and 3 and inserted in between the terminals 2 and 3 to bring cell C<sub>2</sub> in the circuit. Jockey is slided on wire and null deflection position P<sub>2</sub> is noted. Suppose distance of P<sub>2</sub> from A is l<sub>2</sub> i.e. AP<sub>2</sub> = Z<sub>2</sub> The emf of cell C<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>2</sub> = kl<sub>2</sub> &#8230; (ii)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117838" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 198" width="312" height="46" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png 312w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /><br />
Thus emf&#8217;s of cells may be compared. Out of these cells if one is standard cell, then the emf of other cell may be calculated.<br />
(b) Causes for one sided deflection :<br />
(i) Potential difference between the ends of the potentiometer wire is less than the emf of the cell in the secondary circuit.<br />
(ii) The positive side of the driving cell is connected to the negative terminal of the cell in the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Question 127.<br />
(a) State Kirchhoff&#8217;s rules for an electric network. Using Kirchhoff&#8217;s rules, obtain the . balance condition in terms of the resistances<br />

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117842" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-202.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 202" width="184" height="169" /><br />
Answer:<br />
(i)</p>
<p>(a) Principle : The basic principle of a potentiometer is that &#8220;when a constant current flows through a wire of uniform cross-sectional area and composition, the potential drop across any length of the wire is directly proportional to that length.<br />
\(v \propto l\)</p>
<p>Comparison of emf&#8217;s of two cells: First of all the ends of potentiometer are connected to a battery Bx,<br />
key K and rheostat Rh such that the positive terminal of battery B, is connected to end A of the wire. This completes the primary circuit.</p>
<p>Now the positive terminals of the cells C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> whose emfs are to be compared are connected to A and the negative terminals to the jockey J through a two-way key and a galvanometer (fig). This is the secondary circuit.</p>
<p>Method:<br />
(i) By closing key K, a potential difference is established and rheostat is so adjusted that when jockey J’is made to touch at ends A and B of wire, the deflection in galvano¬meter is on both sides. Suppose in this position the potential gradient is k.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117835" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 196" width="409" height="275" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196.png 409w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-196-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 409px) 100vw, 409px" /><br />
(ii) Now plug is inserted between the terminals 1 and 3. so that cell C<sub>1</sub> is included in the secondary circuit and jockey J is slided on the wire at P<sub>1</sub> (say) to obtain the null point. The distance of P<sub>1</sub> from A is measured. Suppose this length is l<sub>1</sub>, i.e. AP<sub>1</sub> = l<sub>1</sub><br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117836" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 197" width="307" height="23" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197.png 307w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-197-300x22.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px" /><br />
(iii) Now plug is taken off between the terminals 1 and 3 and inserted in between the terminals 2 and 3 to bring cell C<sub>2</sub> in the circuit. Jockey is slided on wire and null deflection position P<sub>2</sub> is noted. Suppose distance of P<sub>2</sub> from A is l<sub>2</sub> i.e. AP<sub>2</sub> = Z<sub>2</sub> The emf of cell C<sub>2</sub>, e<sub>2</sub> = kl<sub>2</sub> &#8230; (ii)<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117838" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 198" width="312" height="46" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198.png 312w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-198-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 312px) 100vw, 312px" /><br />
Thus emf&#8217;s of cells may be compared. Out of these cells if one is standard cell, then the emf of other cell may be calculated.<br />
(b) Causes for one sided deflection :<br />
(i) Potential difference between the ends of the potentiometer wire is less than the emf of the cell in the secondary circuit.<br />
(ii) The positive side of the driving cell is connected to the negative terminal of the cell in the secondary circuit.</p>

(b) A simple device, based on the above condition is &#8216;Meter Bridge&#8217;.<br />
Working of Meter Bridge :</p>
<p>Metre Bridge is special case of Wheatstone Bridge<br />
It is a device based on Wheatstone bridge to determine the unknown resistance of a wire. Principle : Meter bridge is based on the principle of wheatstone bridge, i.e. when bridge is balanced<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117806" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-168.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 168" width="242" height="50" /><br />
Circuit : To find the unknown resistance S, the circuit is completed as shown in figure. The unknown resistance wire of resistance S is connected across the gap between points C and D and a resistance box (R) is connected across the gap between the points A and D. A cell, a rheostat and a key (K) is connected between the point A and C by means of connecting screws. In the experiment when the sliding jockey touches the wire AC at any point, then the wire is divided into two parts. These two parts AB and BC act as the resistances P and Q of the Wheatstone bridge. In this way the resistances of arms AB, BC, AD and DC form the resistances P, Q, R and S of Wheatstone bridge. Thus the circuit of meter bridge is the same as that of Wheatstone bridge.<br />

Method : To determine the unknown resistance first of all key K is closed and a resistance R is taken in the resistance box in such a way that on pressing jockey B at end points A and C, the deflection in galvanometer is on both the sides. Now jockey is slided on wire at such a position that on pressing the jockey on the wire at that point, there is no deflection in the galvanometer G. In this position the points B and D are at the same potential, therefore the bridge is balanced. The point B is called the null point. The length of both parts AB and BC of the wire are read on the scale. The condition of balance of Wheatstone bridge is,<br />

If r is the resistance per cm length of wire AC and l cm is the length of wire AB, then length of wire BC will be (100 &#8211; l) cm<br />
∴ P = resistance of wire AB = lr<br />
Q = resistance of wire BC = (100 &#8211; l)r<br />
Substituting these values in equation (i), we get<br />

As the resistance (R) of wire (AB) is known, the resistance S may be calculated.</p>
<p>A number of observations are taken for different resistances taken in resistance box and S is calculated each time and the mean value of S is found.</p>
<p>Precautions:<br />
(i) In this experiment the resistance of the copper strips and connecting screws have not been taken into account. These resistances are called end-resistances. Therefore very small resistances cannot be found accurately by metre bridge. The resistance S should not be very small.<br />
(ii) The current should not flow in the metre bridge wire for a long time, otherwise the wire will become hot and its resistance will be changed.</p>
<p>Question 131.<br />
(a) Why do the &#8216;free electrons&#8217;, in a metal wire, &#8216;flowing by themselves&#8217;, not cause any current flow in the wire?<br />
Define &#8216;drift velocity&#8217; and obtain an expression for the current flowing in a wire, in terms of the &#8216;drift velocity&#8217; of the free electrons.<br />
(b) Use the above expression to show that the &#8216;resistivity&#8217;, of the material of a wire, is’ inversely proportional to the &#8216;relaxation time&#8217; for the &#8216;free electrons&#8217; in the metal. (Comptt. Outside Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a) (i) The free electrons, in a metal, (flowing by themselves), have a random distribution of their velocities. Hence the net charge crossing any cross section in a unit time is zero.<br />
(ii) The drift velocity equals the average (time dependent) velocity acquired by free electrons, under the action of an applied (external) electric field.<br />

<p>Question 132.<br />
(i) Derive an expression for drift velocity of electrons in a conductor. Hence deduce Ohm&#8217;s law.<br />
(ii) A wire whose cross-sectional area is increasing linearly from its one end to the other, is connected across a battery of V volts. Which of the following quantities remain constant in the wire?<br />
(a) drift speed<br />
(b) current density<br />
(c) electric current (d) electric field Justify your answer. (Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(i)<br />
(a) Relation between electric current and drift velocity : Consider a uniform metallic wire XY of length l and cross-sectional area A. A potential difference V is applied across the ends X and Y of the wire. This causes an electric field at each point of the wire of strength :<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117803" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-165.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 165" width="342" height="217" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-165.png 342w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-165-300x190.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 342px) 100vw, 342px" /><br />
Due to this electric field, the electrons gain a drift velocity V<sub>d</sub> opposite to direction of electric field. If q be the charge passing through the cross-section of wire in t seconds, then, current in wire, I = \(\frac{q}{t}\)</p>
<p>The distance transversed by each electron in time (t) = drift velocity × time = V<sub>d</sub>t</p>
<p>If we consider two planes P and Q at a distance V<sub>d</sub>t in a conductor, then the total charge flowing in time t will be equal to the total charge on the electrons present within the cylinder PQ.</p>
<p>The volume of this cylinder = cross sectional area × length = A V<sub>d</sub>t</p>
<p>If n is the number of free electrons in the wire per unit volume, then the number of free electrons in the cylinder = n(A V<sub>d</sub>t)<br />
If charge on each electron is -e (e = 1.6 × 10<sup>-19</sup> C), then the total charge flowing through a cross-section of the wire,<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117804" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-166.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 166" width="341" height="95" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-166.png 341w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-166-300x84.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px" /><br />
This is the relation between electric current and drift velocity. Negative sign shows that the direction of current is opposite to the drift velocity.<br />
(b) Charge = Current × time<br />
(i) For 0 to 5 seconds, the current<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117805" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-167.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 167" width="133" height="40" /><br />
Hence, q<sub>1</sub> = (2.5) × (5) = 12.5 C<br />
(ii) For 5 sec to 10 sec, the current = 5A<br />
Hence, q<sub>2</sub> = 5 × (10 &#8211; 5) = 5 × 5 = 25 C<br />
q = q<sub>1</sub> + q<sub>2</sub> = 12.5 + 25 = 37.5 C</p>
<p>(ii) (c) Electric current will remain constant in the wire.<br />
Reason : All other quantities depend on the cross sectional area of the wire and hence will not remain constant.</p>
<p>Question 133.<br />

<p>Question 134.<br />
(a) Draw a circuit diagram of a meter bridge used to determine the unknown resistance R of a given wire. Hence derive the expression for R in terms of the known resistance S.<br />
(b) What does the term &#8216;end error&#8217; in a metre bridge circuit mean and how is it corrected? How will the balancing point be affected, if the positions of the battery and galvanometer are interchanged in a metre bridge experiment? Give reason for your answer. (Comptt. Delhi 2016)<br />
Answer:<br />
(a)</p>
<p>Metre Bridge is special case of Wheatstone Bridge<br />
It is a device based on Wheatstone bridge to determine the unknown resistance of a wire. Principle : Meter bridge is based on the principle of wheatstone bridge, i.e. when bridge is balanced<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117806" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-168.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 168" width="242" height="50" /><br />
Circuit : To find the unknown resistance S, the circuit is completed as shown in figure. The unknown resistance wire of resistance S is connected across the gap between points C and D and a resistance box (R) is connected across the gap between the points A and D. A cell, a rheostat and a key (K) is connected between the point A and C by means of connecting screws. In the experiment when the sliding jockey touches the wire AC at any point, then the wire is divided into two parts. These two parts AB and BC act as the resistances P and Q of the Wheatstone bridge. In this way the resistances of arms AB, BC, AD and DC form the resistances P, Q, R and S of Wheatstone bridge. Thus the circuit of meter bridge is the same as that of Wheatstone bridge.<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117807" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 169" width="334" height="232" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169.png 334w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-169-300x208.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 334px) 100vw, 334px" /><br />
Method : To determine the unknown resistance first of all key K is closed and a resistance R is taken in the resistance box in such a way that on pressing jockey B at end points A and C, the deflection in galvanometer is on both the sides. Now jockey is slided on wire at such a position that on pressing the jockey on the wire at that point, there is no deflection in the galvanometer G. In this position the points B and D are at the same potential, therefore the bridge is balanced. The point B is called the null point. The length of both parts AB and BC of the wire are read on the scale. The condition of balance of Wheatstone bridge is,<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117808" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 170" width="371" height="89" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170.png 371w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-170-300x72.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><br />
If r is the resistance per cm length of wire AC and l cm is the length of wire AB, then length of wire BC will be (100 &#8211; l) cm<br />
∴ P = resistance of wire AB = lr<br />
Q = resistance of wire BC = (100 &#8211; l)r<br />
Substituting these values in equation (i), we get<br />
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-117810" src="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png" alt="Important Questions for Class 12 Physics Chapter 3 Current Electricity Class 12 Important Questions 171" width="339" height="36" srcset="https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171.png 339w, https://www.learncbse.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Important-Questions-for-Class-12-Physics-Chapter-3-Current-Electricity-Class-12-Important-Questions-171-300x32.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 339px) 100vw, 339px" /><br />
As the resistance (R) of wire (AB) is known, the resistance S may be calculated.</p>
<p>A number of observations are taken for different resistances taken in resistance box and S is calculated each time and the mean value of S is found.</p>
<p>(b) The error which arises on account of resistance of copper strips and the connecting wire at both ends of the meter bridge is called end error.<br />
It is minimized by adjusting the balance point near the middle point of the bridge.<br />
• The balancing point will not be affected, as the bridge remains balanced.</p>
<p>Question 135.<br />
(a) State the working principle of a potentiometer with help of a circuit diagram, explain how the internal resistance of a cell is determined.<br />
