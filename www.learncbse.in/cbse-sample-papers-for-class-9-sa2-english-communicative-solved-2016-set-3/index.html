<strong>1.(a) Read the passage given below and complete the sentences that follow :</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The studio, which has different sessions for teaching niche dance forms including salsa, Latin American, ballroom, bhangra, retro, fitness dance and special sessions for homemakers and the elderly, grabbed everyone’s attention in the region when it organised ‘Burst Out’ in Chandigarh. It witnessed 750 people dancing in British School’s Golf Ground. “The event saw participation from everyone inclusing children and the elderly. We will organise another event like this again sometime this year,” she says.</li>
<li>When reminded about the closure of several dance schools in the region, this Reebok Doonya-certified trainer says that the same is happening all over the world. “Around 180 dance schools closed down in the US last year. When it comes to this region, it becomes very tough to survive if you are catering to the niche market and teaching only specialised dance forms. That may still work in metros but not in a place like Chandigarh,” says Shan, a 2009 post­graduate in Communication from Panjab University in Chandigarh.</li>
<li>A firm believer of word of mouth publicity, the fact that students assume that they would grab immense fame after a few sessions is disturbing for Shan. “Why don’t they realise that fame is a by-product ? Dance is about passion. These reality dance shows with judges who have no connection to any dance form have been most damaging in making youngsters think that learning dance is about winning shows, which judge classical, retro and Latin American on the same platform,” she says.</li>
<li>Shan, who has held dance classes across Europe, says facilitating dance is the easy part while running a studio can be exhausting. “High rentals, keeping a constant tab on fads and retaining instructors can be really frustating sometimes,” she explains.</li>
<li>But perhaps it is students like that 72-year-old woman who keep her going.(India Today : Simply Punjabi)</li>

<p><strong>(b) Read the following passage carefully :  </strong><br />
On this day our first thoughts go to the architect of this freedom, the Father of our Nation, who, embodying the old spirit of India, held aloft the torch of freedom and lighted up the darkness that surrounded us. We have often been unworthy followers of his and have strayed from his message, but not only we but succeeding generations will remember this message and bear the imprint in their hearts of this great son of India, magnificent in his faith and strength and courage and humility. We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest.<br />
Our next thoughts must be of the unknown volunteers and soldiers of freedom who, without praise or reward, have served India even unto death.<br />
We think also of our brothers and sisters who have been cut off from us by political boundaries and who unhappily cannot share at present in the freedom that has come. They are of us and will remain of us whatever may happen, and we shall be sharers in their good or ill fortune alike.<br />
The future beckons to us. Whither do we go and what shall be our endeavour ? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease; to build up a prosperous, democratic and progressive nation, and to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman.<br />

More change has occurred in the environmental movement during the past ten years than in its entire previous history. Its thrust has become less ideological and more pragmatic, less New Age and more scientific. It is increasingly grounded in the databases of atmospheric science and the genetic models of conservation biology.<br />
The practice of conservation in particular is now linked to economic development rather than opposed to it, focussed on biological diversity rather than just scenic beauty, broadened to save entire ecosystems rather than individual star species such as pandas and bald eagles, and tilted to put increasing emphasis on those tropical countries where the most severe environmental problems exist.<br />
The next hundred years may well evolve into the century of the environment- during which most societies shift from guns and bullets to butter and trees. All this comes not a moment too soon, if we are to save a failing planet.<br />
A decade ago the public image of environmentalism was burdened with what might be called the Greenpeace metaphor. Environmental issues were caricatured as theatres of ideological conflict, where champions of Nature battled champions of Progress. Liberals, in this view, blocked dams in order to save oddly named small fishes, while conservatives heedlessly sacrificed the environment for short-term profit. The dichotomy was far from exact, but like most oversimplifications it held a lot of truth and reflected accurately some of the larger tensions of American life.<br />
Today, to my distress, some conservative writers continue to treat environmentalism with scepticism or outright hostility. They depict it as one more workshop of the left, a means of enlarging government control and the power of the bureaucratic New Class, and a cudgel with which to beat free market economies and press for a restructuring of society &#8211; in short, a clever scheme to add the environment and its votaries to the Welfare State.<br />
This is a mistake.<br />
The environmental crisis is real. If the heart of the conservation agenda is the preservation of the best in the world in the midst of change, it cannot be limited to institutions, the rule of law, and personal morality, but must also embrace the environment. ‘Conservare’ is the common stem of conservation and conservatism, and perhaps that ancient link should serve as a signature of the basic principle that humanity does not exist apart from nature and will suffer to the extent that we abuse it.<br />
Growth in scientific knowledge has altered the character of the environmental movement and its relation to political and economic life. A global view now prevails. We no longer see changes as isolated episodes-the pollution of a river here or the extinction of a bird species there. Now we see all of these events as having coalesced into worldwide secular trends.<br />
The release of chloroflurocarbons in the northern hemisphere has opened a hole seven thousand miles away in the stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, admitting higher levels of ultraviolet radiation. This local collapse foreshadows the fate of the global atmosphere, threatening higher level of skin cancer and disruption of ecosystems worldwide.<br />
The consumption of huge quantities of beef and timber in the United States accelerates the deforestation of Latin America, dries its great river basins, ruins its soil, and on a larger scale, raises carbon dioxide level in the global atmosphere.<br />
The secular trends can be conveniently classified as the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse : global warming by the greenhouse effect, undeniably coming but at a rate still disputed among atmospheric scientists; ozone depletion, severe and not in dispute, toxic waste accumulation, severe and not in dispute; and mass extinction by habitat destruction, also severe and not in dispute.<br />
Why should these man-induced changes be thought apocalyptic ? After all, environmental change is perpetual, and organisms have always adjusted to it in past geological times. Over millions of years species adapted to alternating climatic warming and cooling, the expansion or shrinkage of continental shelves, the invasion of new competitors and parasites. Those that could not change became extinct, but at such a relatively slow rate that other, better adapted species evolved to replace them.<br />
In the midst of endless turnover, the balance of life was sustained. But now the velocity of change is too great for life to handle, and the equilibrium is shattered. The change is the greatest experienced since the end of the Age of Dinosaurs 65 million years ago. It has reached precipitous levels within a single human life span, a mere tick in geological time. Humanity is creating a radical new environment too quickly to allow the adjustment of species, which need thousands to millions of years to accomplish complex genetic adaptations. Most of life is consequently at risk. Our life is at risk.<br />

<li>The studio, which has different sessions for teaching niche dance forms including salsa, Latin American, ballroom, bhangra, retro, fitness dance and special sessions for homemakers and the elderly, grabbed everyone’s attention in the region when it organised ‘Burst Out’ in Chandigarh. It witnessed 750 people dancing in British School’s Golf Ground. “The event saw participation from everyone inclusing children and the elderly. We will organise another event like this again sometime this year,” she says.</li>
<li>When reminded about the closure of several dance schools in the region, this Reebok Doonya-certified trainer says that the same is happening all over the world. “Around 180 dance schools closed down in the US last year. When it comes to this region, it becomes very tough to survive if you are catering to the niche market and teaching only specialised dance forms. That may still work in metros but not in a place like Chandigarh,” says Shan, a 2009 post­graduate in Communication from Panjab University in Chandigarh.</li>
<li>A firm believer of word of mouth publicity, the fact that students assume that they would grab immense fame after a few sessions is disturbing for Shan. “Why don’t they realise that fame is a by-product ? Dance is about passion. These reality dance shows with judges who have no connection to any dance form have been most damaging in making youngsters think that learning dance is about winning shows, which judge classical, retro and Latin American on the same platform,” she says.</li>
<li>Shan, who has held dance classes across Europe, says facilitating dance is the easy part while running a studio can be exhausting. “High rentals, keeping a constant tab on fads and retaining instructors can be really frustating sometimes,” she explains.</li>
<li>But perhaps it is students like that 72-year-old woman who keep her going.(India Today : Simply Punjabi)</li>

On this day our first thoughts go to the architect of this freedom, the Father of our Nation, who, embodying the old spirit of India, held aloft the torch of freedom and lighted up the darkness that surrounded us. We have often been unworthy followers of his and have strayed from his message, but not only we but succeeding generations will remember this message and bear the imprint in their hearts of this great son of India, magnificent in his faith and strength and courage and humility. We shall never allow that torch of freedom to be blown out, however high the wind or stormy the tempest.<br />
Our next thoughts must be of the unknown volunteers and soldiers of freedom who, without praise or reward, have served India even unto death.<br />
We think also of our brothers and sisters who have been cut off from us by political boundaries and who unhappily cannot share at present in the freedom that has come. They are of us and will remain of us whatever may happen, and we shall be sharers in their good or ill fortune alike.<br />
The future beckons to us. Whither do we go and what shall be our endeavour ? To bring freedom and opportunity to the common man, to the peasants and workers of India; to fight and end poverty and ignorance and disease; to build up a prosperous, democratic and progressive nation, and to create social, economic and political institutions which will ensure justice and fullness of life to every man and woman.<br />

More change has occurred in the environmental movement during the past ten years than in its entire previous history. Its thrust has become less ideological and more pragmatic, less New Age and more scientific. It is increasingly grounded in the databases of atmospheric science and the genetic models of conservation biology.<br />
The practice of conservation in particular is now linked to economic development rather than opposed to it, focussed on biological diversity rather than just scenic beauty, broadened to save entire ecosystems rather than individual star species such as pandas and bald eagles, and tilted to put increasing emphasis on those tropical countries where the most severe environmental problems exist.<br />
The next hundred years may well evolve into the century of the environment- during which most societies shift from guns and bullets to butter and trees. All this comes not a moment too soon, if we are to save a failing planet.<br />
A decade ago the public image of environmentalism was burdened with what might be called the Greenpeace metaphor. Environmental issues were caricatured as theatres of ideological conflict, where champions of Nature battled champions of Progress. Liberals, in this view, blocked dams in order to save oddly named small fishes, while conservatives heedlessly sacrificed the environment for short-term profit. The dichotomy was far from exact, but like most oversimplifications it held a lot of truth and reflected accurately some of the larger tensions of American life.<br />
Today, to my distress, some conservative writers continue to treat environmentalism with scepticism or outright hostility. They depict it as one more workshop of the left, a means of enlarging government control and the power of the bureaucratic New Class, and a cudgel with which to beat free market economies and press for a restructuring of society &#8211; in short, a clever scheme to add the environment and its votaries to the Welfare State.<br />
This is a mistake.<br />
The environmental crisis is real. If the heart of the conservation agenda is the preservation of the best in the world in the midst of change, it cannot be limited to institutions, the rule of law, and personal morality, but must also embrace the environment. ‘Conservare’ is the common stem of conservation and conservatism, and perhaps that ancient link should serve as a signature of the basic principle that humanity does not exist apart from nature and will suffer to the extent that we abuse it.<br />
Growth in scientific knowledge has altered the character of the environmental movement and its relation to political and economic life. A global view now prevails. We no longer see changes as isolated episodes-the pollution of a river here or the extinction of a bird species there. Now we see all of these events as having coalesced into worldwide secular trends.<br />
The release of chloroflurocarbons in the northern hemisphere has opened a hole seven thousand miles away in the stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, admitting higher levels of ultraviolet radiation. This local collapse foreshadows the fate of the global atmosphere, threatening higher level of skin cancer and disruption of ecosystems worldwide.<br />
The consumption of huge quantities of beef and timber in the United States accelerates the deforestation of Latin America, dries its great river basins, ruins its soil, and on a larger scale, raises carbon dioxide level in the global atmosphere.<br />
The secular trends can be conveniently classified as the four horsemen of the environmental apocalypse : global warming by the greenhouse effect, undeniably coming but at a rate still disputed among atmospheric scientists; ozone depletion, severe and not in dispute, toxic waste accumulation, severe and not in dispute; and mass extinction by habitat destruction, also severe and not in dispute.<br />

Most of life is consequently at risk. Our life is at risk.<br />
<strong>(а)  Do you agree with the view of the author that ‘conservation is linked to economic development’ ? Illustrate your view with examples.</strong><br />
<strong>(b)  What has put our life at risk ?</strong><br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (a) The author is quite right in saying that ‘conservation is linked to economic development’. It can be understood by supposing the contrary. If we continue to fell down trees and build buildings, roads and bridges to accommodate rising populace and meet rising demands, can there be real economic development ? The answer is ‘yes’, but with a rider. New problems will arise such as global warming resulting in extreme weather conditions, droughts, untimely rains, storms, etc. A lot of money will have to be invested to overcome these problems giving a set back to economic development. So conservation of environment is essential if we want real economic development in the long run. A balance will have to be maintained between conservation and economic activities.<br />
(b) The increasing air and water pollution and deforestation have put our life at risk. The increased number of polluting vehicles and factories release a lot of chlorofluorocarbon. It has already caused a hole in the ozone layer, which is worsening weather conditions, raising the levels of skin cancer and disrupting ecosystems worldwide. A radically new environment is being created. The changes are so fast that no species, even humans, can quickly adjust to it. Too much rain and snow and severe drought occur in unexpected places. In times to come we are going to face acute shortages of food and challenges to our living conditions. No one is sure if life will at all be possible on this earth if serious efforts are not made to solve environment related problems.</p>

<ul>
<li>age of competition</li>

<li>craze for playing video games, mobiles, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Ans.                     Health is Wealth</strong><br />
That health is wealth is an old saying, yet it is always true. However, our youngsters do not know the value of this saying. They pay no attention to their health. In an age of competition they are too much absorbed in their studies. To make the matters worse, they spend their spare time in watching TV, playing video games, browsing the Net or chatting on mobiles. They lead a stressful life in a race to get good marks or grades. Consequently, they suffer from ill health. Many of them are obese and have low immunity. They frequently fall sick.<br />
In order to be healthy the youngsters should start playing an active, outdoor game or go on a long walk for at least half on hour. They should eat healthy, home-cooked food and avoid junk food. Only then can they become healthy and be able to achieve their goals. They must realize that nothing can be achieved in the absence of good health.</p>

Rahim, a dedicated clerk__________ made enemies within his department for being very honest__________ adverse reports___________ suspended on a false charge_________ fought his case__________ met the minister__________ got his job back<br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Rahim graduated and was able to get a job as a clerk in a government office. It was a good job. Rahim started his work with complete dedication. Soon he came to know that all his colleagues were corrupt and in league with one another. Even his officer was not honest. One day he called him and said, “Rahim, I know you are an honest person. But what is the use of honesty when you are paid so low ? Be practical and tactful. Don’t give me any opportunity to take action against you ?”<br />
He understood, yet he could not make compromises. One day he refused to pass a doubtful case. The very next day he was warned by his officer due to a lapse which was not his in the first place.<br />
Adverse reports began to be sent against him. One day he was shocked when his officer questioned him for taking a bribe from a businessman. He tried to defend himself, but in vain. He was suspended after a week.<br />
He was crest fallen. His mother enthused him and asked him to meet the minister in charge of his department. He reluctantly went to see the minister. He was surprised to find a young, energetic person in the chair. He listened to his tale and assured him of an impartial enquiry. He came back.<br />
In about a fortnight he got a call from the minister himself, “Rahim, join your duties from tomorrow. You are acquitted of the false charge of bribery. You have been promoted to the post of an assistant. Hope you will continue to serve with honesty throughout your life. I am proud of such persons as you are. The country needs honest persons.”</p>

(iii) What signal did her mother’s false teeth give to the poet ?<br />
(iv) How did the Bishop help Mere Gringoire, and why ?<br />
<strong>Ans</strong>.(i)Yes, John is a hypocrite. He has married an aristocratic lady belonging to a royal English family whereas he is an ordinary salesman. But ironically, he criticises the best sellers for mixing scenes and characters, for example, an American romancing a royal princess from Europe.<br />
(ii)The world is like a stage on which the drama of life is enacted. Here God is the director who controls everything like a director in a drama. We are mere players, as Shakespeare says, who appear on the stage, play our part and exit.<br />
(iii)Her mother’s false teeth gave her the signal that if she did not take care of her teeth, she, too, would have to get the false teeth for herself.<br />
(iv)Mrs Gringoire, an old, ailing lady was in distress. She was not able to pay her rent. The Bailiff threatened to throw her out if she failed to pay the rent. The Bishop who had no money to help her sold his silver salt-cellars to help the poor lady to pay her rent.</p>
<p><strong>10.Answer the following question in 80-100 words.</strong><br />
Comment upon the following extract, drawing a parallel to the fate of the rain and the fate of man :<br />
T am the sigh of the sea;<br />
The laughter of the field;<br />
The tears of heaven.’<br />
Or<br />
The convict’s story proves that no one is a born criminal. Why do, then we often hate and punish the criminals severely ?<br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> The poem ‘Song of the Rain’ brings out a clear parallel between the fate of the rain and that of man. The rain, as the poet says, is born in the shape of a cloud. It originates from the sea. It falls down on the earth to quench the thirst of the field. The field becomes happy. It falls in the shape of watery drops as if they were the tears of heaven, for it is the death of the rain as well.<br />
Like the rain, man comes out of the mother’s womb. On his birth all are happy. He grows up, grows old, decays and dies. Everybody is sad, and sheds tears on his death.<br />
Thus, the parallel between the fate of rain and man’s is clear.<br />
Or<br />
There is no doubt that no one is a bom criminal. The convict in the play ‘The Bishop’s Candlesticks’ was once a normal human being. He stole out of a dire need to save his ailing and starving wife. No one paid any attention to his circumstances. He was sent to jail where he was tortured like an animal. He became a hardened criminal.<br />
It is strange but true that we hate criminals without ever thinking as to what made them criminals. We are perhaps callous by nature. We forget that circumstances make us saints or criminals. We need to cultivate a healing touch, like the one used by the Bishop in the play, in dealing with the criminal. Only then can we remove crimes from our society.</p>
<p><strong>11.Answer the following question in 150-200 words.</strong><br />
What did Munodi, the former Governor of Lagado, inform Gulliver of the conditions in Balnibarbi ?<br />
Or<br />
How did the master of Houyhnhnms react to Gulliver’s account of his country ?<br />
Or<br />
What impression do you form of George ?<br />
Or<br />
What does the narrator recall of his experience with ‘the Pride of the Thames’ ? How was his experience of the hired-boat unpleasant ?</p>
<p><strong>Ans.</strong> In his conversation with Gulliver, Munodi, the former Governor of Lagado, tells about the conditions prevailing in Balnibarbi. Some forty years before, he says, some persons from Balnibarbi went to Laputa. They stayed there for five months. They studied the schemes followed by the people of Laputa. When they came back, they introduced some new schemes in the fields of arts, sciences and mechanics. They set up academies of projects in many cities. In all these academies the professors chalked out new schemes, new methods of agriculture and building. They used new instruments and tools for trade and manufacture. In the new system one man was competent to do the job of ten. The building were so designed and made as to last forever with repairing.<br />
But then there was another side of the picture. In following the ambitious plans the new-age innovators and scientists remained without food or clothes. Their houses were in ruins. Munodi did not toe the lines of these impractical dreamers. He followed old methods and was, thus, unacceptable in the kingdom. He had preserved his estate in its original form.<br />
Or<br />
Gulliver told the master of the Houyhnhnms that there were a large number of Houyhnhnms (horses) in his country. Human servants were employed to look after them and keep them neat and clean. The Houyhnhnms, added Gulliver, were used in chariots and taken care of until they grew old and then discarded. Their hoofs were shod with iron in order to preserve the hoofs from being broken. They were often castrated to tame them.<br />
The master of the Houyhnhnms felt humiliated on listening to Gulliver’s account. He became angry and wondered if the human beings were rational in treating the horses in such a shabby manner.<br />
Gulliver further told the master of Houyhnhnms about himself and his parents. He also told him about his country. His country, he said, was governed by the queen. His people suffered from many ailments, evils and vices. Theft, robbery, forgery and rape have brought misery in their lives.<br />
The whole account was beyond the comprehension of the master of the Houyhnhnms. He was, however, unhappy with what he was told.<br />
Or<br />
George is an important member of the rowing party. He is, on the whole, a shirker and short tempered, though at times we feel he is not as irritable as he seems to be. He loves to get up late to enjoy his sleeps. Whenever he gets up early he feels very irritable. Once he had a very bad experience of getting up early at Mrs Gippings. He went out at 3 a.m. thinking that it was about to be 9 a. m. He became a suspect in the eyes of the policemen.<br />
He is not as jolly as the narrator. When the narrator wets his shirt accidentally, he gets angry and does not view it as a funny incident. He is fond of playing banjo. The narrator and Harris do not have good opinion about his ability to play banjo well. However, they become sentimental when George plays Two Lovely Black Eyes’. In a country inn he deliberately goads a man to make a story about the trout in the glass-case. It reveals his mischievous nature. He is also practical. He knows that rowing in a continuous rain may prove to be harmful. So he suggests abandoning the boat and reaching their destination by train.<br />
Or<br />
The narrator does not think high of the hired-boats. A hired-boat cannot be such that can be displayed. It is invariably in a bad condition. The man in the hired up-river boat is modest and retiring.<br />
The narrator recalls a bad experience. Once he was one of a party who hired an up-river boat for a few days’ trip. They had written for a double sculling skiff. When they went to the yard, the man asked one Jim to fetch round The Pride of the Thames’. The boat which was brought was hardly a boat. It was a chunk of wood. It looked as if it had been dug out of somewhere and dug out carelessly. It was a Roman relic of some sort. When the party refused to take it, the boat- builder himself came, and assured them that it was really a skiff to take them on their trip down the river. He found no fault in it. When no one in the party was convinced, he got angry and said it was the best boat in all his stock, and was in use for the last forty years.<br />
The narrator and his associates had to take the boat. They said their prayers and stepped on board. They were charged thirty-five shillings.</p>
