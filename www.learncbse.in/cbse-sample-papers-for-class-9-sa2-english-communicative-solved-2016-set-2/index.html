<strong>1.(a) Read the passage given below and complete the sentences that follow :</strong><br />
<strong>                        Keeping Your Brain Young</strong><br />
You probably don’t give it much thought, but your brain needs good nutrition, workout, and good sleep, as much as any other major muscle group. These can help boost creativity, memory and keep the brain young. Excess dietary fat, especially saturated fat, usually clogs the arteries reducing the blood flow to the brain and causing it to age prematurely.<br />
Conversely, the lower the saturated fat in your diet, the body will eventually flush out the excess fat from your arteries restoring normal blood supply to the brain, for it rejuvenation. A healthy diet rich in colorful fruit, omega-3 fatty acids and whole grain aids improved functioning of the brain. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants which benefit brain chemistry. Colored vegetables and fruits, walnuts, flax seeds, green tea, fish etc. are brain food in the real sense. Exercise seems to support the brain the same way as it helps cardiac health; by improving the blood flow which means more oxygen and nutrients reach the brain cells and sustain their optimal functioning. A good night‘s sleep is immensely de-stressing and good for your brain. Stress hormones which get released in response to mental stress can have a negative impact on the brain. Putting away all your gadgets-phone, remote tablet etc.-and enjoying a little time relaxing during the day is a good idea. Mental gamers are fun, challenging and competitive-a great way to exercise your mind. When it comes to brain fitness, the bottom line is ‘to use it or lose it’.</p>

<p>Kamla was seven and smart. She was already very conscious that she was one of the short girls in the class. Now having to wear spectacles would be an added misery as other girls will stare and giggle at her. When Kamla went to school the next day, wearing the horrid spectacles, all that she had feared really did happen. She asked her best friend to hide her spectacles. When her class teacher entered the class, Kamla was all jittery. She pulled her spectacles off her nose and shove them into the desk. Now Kamla felt good. She realized that the spectacles made the bridge of her nose hurt; they hurt her behind her ears as well and that made her temples throb. But the problem soon began. Kamla could not read what was written on the blackboard. During the short break, her spectacles were gone. Soon there was commotion. Word got around that Kamla’s spectacles were missing. Kamla stood up and spoke in a troubled voice, “Please teacher, my spectacles are gone from my desk”. “I have good news for you Kamla”, said her teacher. “I saw you pushing the spectacles into your desk. During the short break I took them and kept them here”, she said pointing to her own desk. Kamla promptly put the spectacles on and never thought of taking them off, again.<br />

<strong>1.(a) Read the passage given below and complete the sentences that follow :</strong><br />
<strong>                        Keeping Your Brain Young</strong><br />
You probably don’t give it much thought, but your brain needs good nutrition, workout, and good sleep, as much as any other major muscle group. These can help boost creativity, memory and keep the brain young. Excess dietary fat, especially saturated fat, usually clogs the arteries reducing the blood flow to the brain and causing it to age prematurely.<br />
Conversely, the lower the saturated fat in your diet, the body will eventually flush out the excess fat from your arteries restoring normal blood supply to the brain, for it rejuvenation. A healthy diet rich in colorful fruit, omega-3 fatty acids and whole grain aids improved functioning of the brain. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants which benefit brain chemistry. Colored vegetables and fruits, walnuts, flax seeds, green tea, fish etc. are brain food in the real sense. Exercise seems to support the brain the same way as it helps cardiac health; by improving the blood flow which means more oxygen and nutrients reach the brain cells and sustain their optimal functioning. A good night‘s sleep is immensely de-stressing and good for your brain. Stress hormones which get released in response to mental stress can have a negative impact on the brain. Putting away all your gadgets-phone, remote tablet etc.-and enjoying a little time relaxing during the day is a good idea. Mental gamers are fun, challenging and competitive-a great way to exercise your mind. When it comes to brain fitness, the bottom line is ‘to use it or lose it’.</p>

<strong>(b)Read the following passage carefully.</strong></p>
<p>Kamla was seven and smart. She was already very conscious that she was one of the short girls in the class. Now having to wear spectacles would be an added misery as other girls will stare and giggle at her. When Kamla went to school the next day, wearing the horrid spectacles, all that she had feared really did happen. She asked her best friend to hide her spectacles. When her class teacher entered the class, Kamla was all jittery. She pulled her spectacles off her nose and shove them into the desk. Now Kamla felt good. She realized that the spectacles made the bridge of her nose hurt; they hurt her behind her ears as well and that made her temples throb. But the problem soon began. Kamla could not read what was written on the blackboard. During the short break, her spectacles were gone. Soon there was commotion. Word got around that Kamla’s spectacles were missing. Kamla stood up and spoke in a troubled voice, “Please teacher, my spectacles are gone from my desk”. “I have good news for you Kamla”, said her teacher. “I saw you pushing the spectacles into your desk. During the short break I took them and kept them here”, she said pointing to her own desk. Kamla promptly put the spectacles on and never thought of taking them off, again.<br />

(b) Write a letter to the Editor of the Hindustan Times highlighting the good work done by the local municipal administration in cleaning your locality after you brought the appalling condition to their notice.<br />
<strong>Ans</strong>. (a) No, I do not agree with the statement. There are many ways to make the cleanliness campaign successful. All factories should have waste treatment plants to clean the effluents before they are released into the water. It will keep the water resources clean. All wastes, household or industrial, should be disposed of in proper manner. Then to keep the streets clean there should be no water logging. Our cities look ugly because people thoughtlessly disfigure the walls with posters or stickers, and throw vegetable and fruit waste on roads. All types of wastes need to be properly segregated and treated. Proper dumping grounds in every village, town or city should be arranged or provided for. The government can set up waste treatment plants. It must put a ban on non-biodegradable waste.<br />

Sir<br />
Subject: Good work done by the MC Faridabad<br />
Kindly let me appreciate the good work done by the municipal corporation of our city through the columns of your popular newspaper.<br />
The Welfare Society of our colony brought to the notice of the local administration about the appalling condition of roads and streets. Heaps of refuge and waste could be seen in every nook and corner. The roads were all broken. The narrow lanes were without lights. Stray cattle and dogs wandered freely. The public parks were not properly maintained.<br />
I would like to put on record the gratefulness of the residents of our colony for the concerned officials who took pains to completely change the face of our colony. They arranged for proper dumping of refuse and wasteful products. Public parks were provided with gardeners for proper upkeep. New metalled roads and streets with adequate lighting have really made our colony a matter of envy for others. The problem of stray animals still persists but hopefully it will, too, be solved in due course of time.<br />
Yours truly<br />

<strong>Ans.</strong> Wednesday, May 24<br />
10 pm<br />
Today I saw some pictures of possible landing of astronauts on the Mars. I wish I could be one of the astronauts. I know it is very difficult to become an astronaut. But if I ever become one, I would be thrilled. I would feel safe in my space suit, though it would be quite cumbersome. I would be in contact with the base through remote-controlled device. The Mars would be a dead land. But who knows I might come across some living beings there ? A Nasa picture shows a figure of a lady standing on a rock. The scientists believe that the figure is illusory. But suppose I come across some Martian ? Would he or she treat me kindly ? So far as I am concerned, I would like to befriend him or her.<br />
May God fulfil my wish in some way!</p>

<p><strong>Ans.                        A Brave Act</strong><br />
Yesterday, I was going to school. On the way, I saw a child in the middle of the road. A car was coming at full speed. I realized the danger to the child. In a split second I jumped into the road to save the child. The next moment there was darkness before my eyes.<br />
When I regained my senses I found myself on the bed in a hospital. Mother and Father were standing anxiously beside my bed. When I opened my eyes, my first question was, “Is the child dead or alive ?” Mother, in tears, said, ‘Yes, yes, dear, the child is safe. How do you feel now ?”<br />
“I am okay, fine. What happened ?”<br />
You were slightly hit by the car, but thank God, you were not harmed much. You received only a few injuries. God is great,” Father said in a low tone.<br />
After a week I was back home. The parents of Ritu-the child whom I had saved had visited me. They were all praise for my bravery and expressed their gratitude to me, and blessed me.<br />
My joy knew no bounds when I learnt that I had been nominated for the President’s gallantry award. My parents were delighted. My teachers patted me.<br />
“Am I really brave ?”-the question haunts me when I am alone.</p>

The Professor’s humiliation was a consequence of his own folly. Comment with reference to ‘The Man Who Knew Too Much’.<br />
Or<br />
What kind of life do you think the convict would opt for after taking leave of the Bishop ?<br />
<strong> Ans</strong>. Private Quelch, called Professor in jest, was in the habit of finding faults, sermonizing and publicly correcting others. He was not tactful. He berated even his seniors in public. When the Sergeant was telling about the muzzle speed,he interrupted him by correcting him before others. When the Corporal was saying that a grenade could be divided into a large number of fragments, the I Professor could not check himself. He said that a grenade has forty four segments. The Corporal felt humiliated but said nothing. When the platoon officer asked him to nominate one of the trainees for permanent cookhouse duties, he sent the Professor’s name. Thus, the Professor was sent to the kitchen. He had to suffer the consequences of his own follies.<br />
Or<br />
The convict is arrested on the suspicion of stealing the Bishop’s candlesticks. He is brought to the Bishop. The Bishop surprises the convict by telling the police that he is his friend and that the candlesticks were his gift to him. The police frees the dazed convict. When the Bishop gives the convict his candlesticks again and shows him a safe path to Paris, the convict is totally reformed. He promises to lead a better and reformed life. He says that he has regained his faith in God, goodness and humanity. We feel that he will definitely lead a normal life, away from the bad memories of his past. He will not fall a victim to temptations again.</p>
<p><strong>11.Answer the following question in about 150-200 words.</strong><br />
The Grand Academy of Lagado is not beyond human comprehension, but quite plausible if we compare it with our own laboratories and experiments. Give a comparative study.<br />
Or<br />
The Houyhnhnms were generous. They had a great impact on Gulliver, Illustrate.<br />
Or<br />
The three friends decide to go for a swim in the river. Why does the plan change in the morning ? How does the author become a hero ?<br />
Or<br />
What do you learn about the characters of Jerome and Harris from the incident of preparing Irish stew ?<br />
<strong>Ans.</strong> Gulliver visited the Grand Academy of Lagado situated in a series of houses on both sides of a street. There were about five hundred rooms in which scientists were working on several projects. Gulliver met an unkempt scientist who had been working on extracting sunbeams from cucumber for eight years. He was yet to succeed in this strange experiment. There was a room in which an architect was working on designing a fantastic way of constructing a house-beginning at the roof and working downwards just as the bee and spider do. Then there was a silk maker and a physician who were working on equally strange projects. There was a mathematician who wrote the preposition and demonstration on a thin wafer and made his students swallow it.<br />
Such experiments were beyond human comprehension, but quite plausible if we compare them with those going on in our own laboratories. The scientists working on building colonies on the Mars or on resurrecting extinct animals like dinosaurs or mammoths seem to be equally absurd and incomprehensible. But looking in the retrospect, many absurd-seeming ideas and theories had come to be true.<br />
Or<br />
The Houyhnhnms had a great impact on Gulliver. Gulliver thought that they could be models for human beings to follow. He found that Houyhnhnms were very rational and logical. They had no idea of evil in a rational being. Then they believed in friendship and benevolence. These were the two prime qualities found in them. That is why, they took no time in befriending a stranger from another part of the globe. They treated him very nicely. They did their best to make him feel at home. They taught him their language so that they had no problem in communicating with him.<br />
Houyhnhnms were quite decent and polite in behavior. They were altogether unaware of ceremony. They were very honest, helpful and cooperative. Gulliver found to his surprise that they would quickly make up any shortage of any commodity in any part of their country. They were also aware of the value and necessity of population control. When one of their females had produced one of each sex, she would stop mating with her consort. In fact, the whole race knew how to preserve itself and prevents it from degeneration.<br />
What made Houyhnhnms an enviable race was their remarkable way of education. They taught their children to love and respect the whole species. They emphasised the values of temperance, industry, exercise and cleanliness in their teachings. The young ones were trained in strength, speed and hardiness by encouraging them to run races up and down steep hills.<br />
Or<br />
The three friends &#8211; Harris, George and the narrator (author) &#8211; decided to go for a swim in the river in the morning. When morning came it was very cold. No one could dare to go for a swim. The narrator was also unwilling but somehow he went to the river. He tried to have a dip into the water by holding on to a branch of a tree that dipped down into the water. He wanted to show that he was not timid. But the branch gave way and the narrator fell into the water which was very cold.<br />
He came out and put up a brave face. He told his friends that he enjoyed the swim and wanted them to have a dip into the water. But no one was ready to take a chance. They let him become a hero if he so wished. Later, he put his shirt in a hurry and somehow put it into the water. George laughed at it. The narrator lost his cool but then he realized that it was not his but George’s shirt. When he pointed it to George, George got furious. The narrator could not help laughing.<br />
Or<br />
The incident of preparing Irish stew is quite humorous. It also sheds light on certain aspects of the characters of Harris and the narrator (Jerome). Both Harris and Jerome were bad at cooking. They were also not consistent. They got bored soon with a task in hand. For instance, they started peeling potatoes. At first, the task looked very easy and entertaining to them. But soon they got tired. The more they peeled the potatoes the more they were dissatisfied with their performance. They reduced the potatoes to the size of peas. George saw them make a mess of the whole thing. He was horrified and asked them to stop peeling the potatoes. He asked to scrape the potatoes instead. Harris and the narrator started scrapping the potatoes, which was quite a tedious job for them. They continued their job for about twenty-five minutes. They could scrape only four potatoes. They were totally exhausted.<br />
George washed half a dozen potatoes and without peeling them put them into the frying pan. Harris wanted to make the stew in a novel way. He put everything they had in the pan. He even put a rat into the frying pan. It was Montmorency’s contribution. Thus, the incident shows that Harris and the narrator were bad cooks. They were inconsistent and impatient. Harris was also an innovator who was least bothered about what he invented.</p>
